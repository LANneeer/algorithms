This garment gives the poem its modern title.\n The poem is known from the 13th-century  , which was created at a   in Wales. It survived as an interpolation in the manuscript of the early medieval epic poem  , attributed to the semi-legendary bard  .\n Dating the poem's composition exactly is difficult, but the consensus among modern scholars is that it derives from a text which was written down during the second half of the seventh century in the  .\n The poem provides insight into the Celtic-speaking culture of early medieval  , as well as possible linguistic evidence for features of the extinct   language. It has also been used to provide evidence of the fauna of central Britain during this period and the late survival of the   in Britain.\n The poem, which is 17 lines long, is addressed to the baby boy Dinogad, wrapped in a marten-skin smock in his cradle, and describes how his father used to set out on a hunt.  The smock to which the poem refers is a long dress which would have typically been worn by infants.  The poem first describes the smock and then lists the animals which were caught in the past by Dinogad's father, stating the heroic manner in which he caught them and his qualities as a hunter.  It can be assumed that Dinogad's father was a powerful individual, as a marten-skin smock would have been an extremely valuable object, and the poem makes reference to his possessing at least eight slaves. \n The narrative voice of the song is that of Dinogad's mother,  and the poem functions both as a   and a   for her husband.  This tone of lament is created by the narrator's exclusive use of the past tense to refer to the deeds of Dinogad's father, indicating he is dead.      argues that this use of the past tense is intended to poignantly remind listeners that fallen British warriors left behind widows and orphans. \n In his analysis of the poem, Orme argues that it serves to describe the father's role as provider for the family, comparing it to the modern lullaby  . He also highlights the informative use of the poem and its provision of details on local terrain, animals and hunting, which would be useful to the listening child and may also serve to inspire their imagination. \n The text was likely originally set to music,  though its original tune is lost.  Musicologist Joyce Andrews believes that the tender care of the mother for her infant child is referenced in the text, and that by extension the song is connected to \"the uniquely female experience of childbirth\". \n Dinogad's smock, speckled, speckled,\n I made from the skins of martens.\n Whistle, whistle, whistly\n we sing, the eight slaves sing.\n When your father used to go to hunt,\n with his shaft on his shoulder and his club in his hand,\n he would call his speedy dogs,\n \"Giff, Gaff, catch, catch, fetch, fetch!\",\n he would kill a fish in a coracle,\n as a lion kills an animal.\n When your father used to go to the mountain,\n he would bring back a roebuck, a wild pig, a stag,\n a speckled grouse from the mountain,\n a fish from the waterfall of Derwennydd\n Whatever your father would hit with his spear,\n whether wild pig or lynx or fox,\n nothing that was without wings would escape.\n Place-name evidence as well as the poem's preservation in the   show that it must have been composed between the 5th and the 11th centuries in one of the kingdoms of the  .  The poem mentions a river called  , deriving from the    , the origin of the modern river name   which is found at various locations in northern England. \n    argued that, as the poem was preserved as part of  , which recounts the deeds of the men of the  , it most likely refers to the Derwent closest to their territory: the  .  However, since the poem clearly does not form part of the original text of  , and was instead added to it through scribal error, the consensus among modern scholars is that there is no reason to favour a location within or near Gododdin territory. \n The mention of a   (modern Welsh  , \"waterfall\") on the   also argues against the Durham Derwent, which has no waterfalls along its course.  For this reason, and its proximity to mountains (  in the poem) R. G. Gruffydd proposed the   as the identity of  ,  and this view is now generally accepted.  If this is the case, it seems likely that the   mentioned in the text refer to  , not actually on the Derwent, but very close to the point where it enters  . This would place the setting of the poem within the probable bounds of the medieval kingdom of  . \n Dinogad's Smock is recorded in a 13th-century manuscript, which is likely to have been copied in   from a manuscript originating in the  . For this reason its orthography is   but it contains features which reveal information about the   language, a sister language of Welsh spoken until around the 12th century in southern Scotland and Cumbria. \n Among the text's unusual linguistic features is the use of the unique first person preterite singular verb form   in the second line (\" \" > \"I made from the skins of Martens\") which suggests, according to linguist  , that the original lullaby may have been composed in  .  Another feature found in the poem but absent in historical or modern Welsh is its consistent use of   ( ) to signify an individual animal, for example   (\"a roebuck\") or   (\"a fish\"). This feature is present in  , which leads Koch to argue that this use of   existed in the mutual ancestor of Welsh, Cumbric and Breton but did not survive in Welsh.  Koch also stated in an interview with WalesOnline that the animal names used in the text were not the usual ones found in Welsh and that they represented the forms used in Cumbric. \n The origin of the name   has been reconstructed as   'having a fort in battle', and the same name is commonly found in Welsh as   and later  . In Gaelicised form, it was the personal name of the last recorded  ,  . \n  Craig Cessford, who has written several articles on Dinogad's Smock, suggests that the Dinogad of the poem may be the historical  , son of   and king of a small region of northern England, possibly  . However, Cessford recognises that this theory is unprovable. \n \"Dinogad's Smock\" is known from a single 13th-century manuscript, the  , which was produced at a monastery in Wales.  It is found as an incongruous passage within a version of the epic poem   which recounts the defeat of the men of the Kingdom of Gododdin at the  , fought at some time in the 6th century.  The book is the work of two different scribes, known as Scribe A and Scribe B, with \"Dinogad's Smock\" comprising the eighty-seventh stanza of the former.  As Scribe A used the orthography of Middle Welsh, whereas Scribe B used a mixture of Middle Welsh and Old Welsh, it is believed that Scribe A modernised the language of the sources of the Book of Aneirin, whereas Scribe B initially did so, but then gave up his attempt and preserved the older spellings. \n  is attributed to the semi-legendary bard Aneirin, but \"Dinogad's Smock\" did not originally form part of that work and was instead a separate oral tradition. It seems likely that a scribe noted down the poem in a space on a manuscript, and a later copyist mistakenly believed it to form part of   and interpolated it into the text.  The poem's archaic language suggests that it was added to the same manuscript as   at a   in   in the second half of the seventh century, and that this manuscript, or a copy of it, became one of the sources of the Book of Aneirin. \n    suggests that the initial addition of \"Dinogad's Smock\" to the manuscript of the elegiac   as a marginal note may reflect a recognition by the scribe that the two poems shared a common theme of lament for the dead.  Nicholas Orme states that its inclusion in the manuscript of the Gododdin indicates that the poem was valued as a piece of literature at the time of its recording, rather than being considered a children's song. \n \"Dinogad's Smock\" provides textual evidence for the species present and hunted in early medieval northern Britain. The poem lists seven species of game, marten ( ),   ( ), \"stag\" ( ),   ( ),   ( ),   ( ),   ( ) and possibly lynx ( ).  In the near contemporary archaeological deposits at   in  , the bones of most of these animals have been discovered; deer, fox, grouse, wild boar and a single marten. These finds suggest that the poem provides an accurate picture of species hunted in the region during the early middle ages.  The mention of marten pelts in an elite context supports the existing archaeological and textual evidence for their use in the fabrication of high status clothing in early medieval Britain. \n The identity of the animal referred to in the text as   has been widely debated by scholars. Some, such as   and John Koch, believed it to refer to the red fox, whereas   and T. Conran translated it as \" \". Others, such as Alfred Owen Hughes Jarman and  , tentatively identified it as the lynx. \n Prior to the 1990s, the presence of lynx in 7th-century Britain had been thought unlikely as the animal was believed to have become extinct on the island long before the historical period.  However, evidence for its late survival grew as lynx bones which had previously been assumed to be prehistoric underwent  . Testing of deposits found at Kinsey cave in   revealed that lynx were definitely present there in the 5th century, and possibly as late as 600 AD. Kinsey cave is 80 kilometres (50\u00a0mi) southwest of the Cumbrian Derwent, which is the most widely accepted location for the river   mentioned in \"Dinogad's Smock\", making the survival of the lynx in the area into the seventh century plausible.  Following the radiocarbon dating of the Kinsey cave bones, John Koch stated that, while he still believed   to refer to a fox, the   of the lynx meant that no words for it had survived into modern  , and therefore it was not impossible that   did indeed mean \"lynx\". \n David Hetherington (et al.) argued in 2005 that   demonstrates the survival of lynx into the post-Roman period in Cumbria, and suggested that this strengthens the argument for the potential reintroduction of the lynx into upland areas of the  , in accordance with the UK's obligations under the  .

Its identification and its relation to the term \" \" is debated among modern historians, who variously identify it as a distinct region to the west of Kalinga, a larger region comprising Kalinga and two other regions, a constituent of the greater Kalinga, or the three divisions of Kalinga proper.\n The rulers of three ancient Indian dynasties - the  ,  , and the   - claimed the title   (\"Lord of Trikalinga\"). In addition, the   claimed to rule over Trikalinga, and a   king adopted the title after military successes against the Kalachuris.\n The earliest extant record to mention the term Trikalinga is the 537 CE Jirjingi inscription of the   king Indra-varman I. The next record is the 562 CE Ponnuturu inscription of his successor Samanta-varman. Both these inscriptions describe the kings as   (\"Lord of Trikalinga\"). \n There is no record of any subsequent Eastern Ganga king claiming the title   until the 11th century.  Three later Eastern Ganga kings claimed the title: Vajra-hasta V Ananta-varman, Rajaraja I Devendra-varman, and  . The inscriptions of these kings use the term   (\"Kings of Trikalinga\") for the Eastern Ganga kings in general.  The inscriptions of Ananta-varman Choda-ganga state that Kamarnava-deva, the progenitor of the Ganga dynasty, was the founder of the Trikalinga country. \n The   probably descended from the  , who called themselves   (\"Lord of  \"). The 9th century Somavamshi king Maha-bhava-gupta Janamejaya I moved eastwards, from Kosala towards  , and claimed the title   in his inscriptions issued from a town called Suvarnapura. He seems to have conquered a part of the Trikalinga region, as his inscriptions do not use this title for his father Shiva-gupta. His successors also claimed this title. \n The wife of the Bhanja king Vidyadhara of Vanjulvaka was known as Trikalinga Mahadevi: she was probably a Somavamshi princess. \n The 11th century   king   claimed the title   in the   inscription issued during the first year of his reign, as well as several later inscriptions.  According to historian  , it is possible that Karna inherited this title from his father  , who may have claimed it after a successful campaign in the Trikalinga region. \n The 10th century poet   uses the title   (\"Lord of Trilinga\") for the earlier Kalachuri king Yuvaraja-deva I, in  . Mirashi speculates this to be a mistake for  , but historian   disputes this pointing out that \"Trilinga\" is known to be a distinct geographical region. \n Karna's successors also claimed the title  ; these include  ,  ,  , and  . \n The 966 CE   inscription of the   chief   states that his ancestor Yuddha-malla ruled over   and the three Kalingas ( ), although this record does not use the exact term \"Trikalinga\". \n Several   inscriptions suggest that Trikalinga was a part of their territory. For example: \n The 1297 CE   inscription of Kumara-pala of Kakaredika uses the title   for his overlord, the Chandela king  , who did not actually rule the Trikalinga region. Kumara-pala was originally a Kalachuri vassal, and later shifted his allegiance to the Chandelas. Historian A.M. Shastri theorizes that he erroneously applied the various Kalachuri titles including   to his new overlord.  According to historian P.K. Mishra, the Chandela king adopted the Kalachuri titles after conquering a part of the former Kalachuri territory. \n Epigraphic and literary sources offer several hints for the identification of Trikalinga:\n The following sources suggest that Trikalinga and Kalinga were distinct regions:\n Some modern scholars have suggested that the term Trikalinga referred to three subdivisions of Kalinga:  ,   and  . However, the following sources suggest that these regions were considered distinct from Kalinga: \n According to the following scholars Trikalinga was different from Kalinga, and was located to the west of Kalinga:\n According to following scholars, Trikalinga was a larger region comprising Kalinga as one of its constituents: \n Similarly, the following scholars theorize that Trikalinga referred to the three divisions of Kalinga at its widest extent: \n According to following scholars, Trikalinga refers to three subdivisions of Kalinga proper: \n Some earlier scholars identified Trikalinga with the   region. For example,   identified Trikalinga with the three kingdoms referred to as \"Macco-Calingae\", \" -Calingae\", and \"Calingae\" by the first century Roman author  . Cunningham identified these \"three Kalingas\" as  -  area,  , and Kalinga proper. According to him, the term \" \" is a corruption of \"Trikalinga\".   generally agreed with Cunningham, and interpreted the \"Modogalingae\" mentioned by Pliny as \"Modogalingam\", deriving the term from the Telugu word \"Mudu\" (three) and \"Kalinga\". However, Pliny does not make any connection between these three terms with similar spellings. He mentions Calingae as the tribes nearest to the sea, and then mentions the Mandei people (who can be identified as the people of the Mahendra mountain). He mentions \"Macco-Calingae\" (or \"Maco-Calingae\") as one of tribes of hill-dwelling Brachmanae people, and does not connect them the Calingae in any way. Similarly, according to Pliny, the country of Gangarides and the city of Calingae were two different entities: the later writers John Bostock and H.T. Riley combined the two into a single people called \"Gangarides Calingae\". Further, Pliny describes \"Modogalingae\" as a single tribe living on \"a very large island in the Gangas\", not as three tribes living in or around the Kalinga region. A.M. Shastri notes that \"Telangana\" is more likely a derivative of \"Trilinga\", which is distinct from \"Trikalinga\" as suggested by epigraphic and literary evidence. \n"},

The former Government Printing Office complex, which demonstrates the quality and evolving styles of the work of the  's Office between the 1870s and the 1910s, currently consists of two buildings, built over three different periods: a three-storey brick building facing William Street constructed 1872\u20131874; a three-storey brick building erected along Stephens Lane between 1884 and 1887; and a three-storey brick extension to the Stephens Lane building, constructed along George Street between 1910 and 1912. \n A government printing office was required in Queensland after   when the establishment of the new Colonial Government generated a need for the printing of Hansard, the official report of the proceedings of the Houses of Parliament. Many other items were also printed on the premises, including postage stamps, Government Gazettes, Acts of Parliament, annual reports of departments, survey maps, text books, electoral rolls, school readers, and banknotes. \n The dissemination of   and other government information to the public is vital to the healthy operation of a democracy, ensuring that the business of parliament is accessible to all, and facilitating transparency regarding government decisions. The printing office was therefore integral to the operation of the   \u2013 and its importance was reflected by its proximity to Parliament, the quality and scale of the printing office buildings, and the quality of the documents produced. \n The   was first printed by  , publisher of the  . Pugh was replaced by   of the  , who became the first official   by March 1862.  That year the first purpose-designed government printing office in Queensland, a two-storey timber building (not extant) designed by Queensland's first Colonial Architect,  , was built facing William Street on a ridge running parallel to both William Street and George Street. \n Since the 1820s the north bank of the   and the adjacent ridgeline has featured a concentration of government and associated activities and uses. This ridge was the site of administration buildings for the   penal settlement, which relocated from   to  , occupying this site from 1825 to 1839. When the penal settlement closed, the remnant infrastructure was used by surveyors as a basis for the layout for the new town of Brisbane. Set at right angles to the river, the prisoner's barracks determined  , while the line of buildings along the ridge determined William Street. Streets surveyed parallel to these streets, including George Street, formed Brisbane's rectangular grid.  The house and kitchen of the Commandant of the penal settlement stood on land just south-east of the Government Printing Office, until the Commandant's buildings were demolished c.1861. \n While a range of buildings and activities occurred along George and William Streets after Free Settlement began in 1842, the government maintained its dominant presence in the area. At some sites, such as the   and  , earlier uses were continued. The establishment phase following the creation of Queensland in 1859 saw the new colonial government reserve land parcels and construct a range of buildings to facilitate its functions. The building of   and   along the eastern end of the George Street alignment in the 1860s firmly entrenched the physical reality of a government precinct in the area. \n Due to this government precinct, the Government Printing Office's immediate neighbour to the north-west, the 1851 United Evangelical Church, became a government telegraph office in 1861; hence the naming of \"Telegraph Lane\" between the telegraph office and the printing office. This laneway from William Street to George Street was later renamed Stephens Lane. \n As Queensland grew, so did demands on the Government Printing Office. The 1862 timber building was altered in 1863 and 1864, and in 1865 an L-shaped three-storey brick-and-stone building (not extant), also designed by Tiffin, was constructed to the rear (north-east), using day labour.  It included an underground cistern with a domed top (location unknown) and was connected to the 1862 building. By 1872 the complex included a small engine room, workshop and stables (none of which are extant) behind the 1865 building. That year   (Government Printer 1867 to 1893) requested a new building to cope with the increased work of the Government Printing Office,  and in August 1872 the Secretary for Public Works recommended that   prepare a plan. \n FDG Stanley immigrated to Queensland in 1861 and became one of the most prolific and well known Queensland architects of the late nineteenth century. In 1863 he became a clerk of works in the Office of the Colonial Architect. Upon Tiffin's retirement in 1872, Stanley became Colonial Architect, holding the position until 1881 when he entered private practice. \n Stanley wanted the new building at the Government Printing Office to be constructed with machine-pressed bricks, which were not yet produced in Brisbane. At the time it was reported that he wanted  .  Tenders were called in October 1872,  and the tender of  , for  4,751 plus  170 for machine pressed bricks and  50 for internal dressing, was accepted. The building included stone footings, brick walls, cast iron airbricks to the understorey and at the ceilings, cast iron columns (ground and first floors, front wing only), and water closets (WCs) and a lift at the end of the rear wing on each floor. The roof was steeply pitched to assist ventilation. Construction was estimated to take six months, but the new office was not completed until 1874, with delays being blamed on a shortage of bricklayers. The machinery was installed and gas lights were fitted by April 1874, and the finished cost was  5331/3/6. \n The front (William Street) wing of the new building stood on the site of the 1862 building, which had been demolished in late 1872.  The new William Street building had an \"L\" shape and extended onto the (recently repurchased) land previously occupied by the Commandant's residence, wrapping around the south-east side of the 1865 building. It had an arcade to the street frontage of the ground floor, and the roof was covered in Welsh slate to reduce the risk of fire. Narrow rear verandahs were located on the north-west side of the first and second floors of the rear wing. The ground floor included a public counter, offices, newspaper room, and a large publishing room in the front wing, with a store in the rear wing. The first floor consisted of a composing room in the front wing, with a drying room in the rear wing; while the second floor contained a binding room in the front wing and a ruling room in the rear wing. It was connected to the 1865 building, which included a machine printing room on the ground floor, the engraving and lithographic work on the first floor, and machine ruling and book binding on the second floor. \n In 1879 the neighbouring telegraph office (former church) was converted into the residence of the Government Printer, and in 1880 the engine room at the rear of the 1865 building was enlarged and the stables were demolished. More land was purchased in 1883, prior to further expansion of the Government Printing Office complex onto land to the south-east. A master plan for the Government Printing Office, drawn in 1884, planned a U-shaped building along Telegraph Lane, George Street, and returning along the south-east side of the complex, wrapping around a new engine room.  It also planned a replication of the William Street building on the other side of a \"cart entrance\" from William Street to the engine room, but this never occurred. \n Instead, between 1884 and 1887 three new buildings were constructed, all by John Petrie: a three-storey brick building along Telegraph Lane, with a short elevation to George Street; a two-storey brick engine room (not extant) to the south-east; and a two-storey brick Lithographic Office (not extant) south-east of the engine room. The 1880 engine room extension to the rear of the 1865 building was demolished around this time. \n John Petrie's tender of  13,043 (initially for a two-storey building on Telegraph Lane and the engine room) was accepted in July 1884, plus an extra  8000 in 1885 for the addition of a third storey to the Telegraph Lane building, plus the Lithographic Office.  The Telegraph Lane building, which was separated from the 1865 building by a yard, included a basement; a machine room on the ground floor; reading rooms, fount, paper, material and store rooms on first floor; and a composing room on the second floor. The design has been attributed to  , Colonial Architect from 1883 to 1885.  The engine room was completed in late 1885, and housed steam engines and generators which supplied electricity for Queensland's Parliament House from 1886,  plus smaller steam engines for powering the Government Printing Office's machinery. The other two new buildings were finished in early 1887. \n Changes were later also made to the older buildings within the complex, including the addition of four cast iron columns on the first floor of the front wing of the William Street building in 1890; increasing the height of the 1865 building in 1891 to improve ventilation; and lowering the level of William Street in 1892, requiring construction of a concrete plinth to protect the foundations of the William Street building. In 1897 the brick wall between the public office and accountant's office in the William Street building was removed, with the addition of an extra iron column in its place.  In 1900 zinc roof sheets on the flatter section of the roof of William Street building were replaced with galvanised rib and pans steel. In 1903 the level of Telegraph Lane, which by now had been renamed Stephens Lane, was lowered. Nearby, in 1901 the neighbouring former church was demolished to allow construction of an Executive Building which later became the  . \n The ongoing development of the city and its wharves downstream from the original convict site meant that George Street had become more important than William Street by this time. A three-storey brick extension of the Stephens Lane building along George Street, which became the new \"front\" for the Government Printing Office, was commenced in 1910, while an additional three-storey brick extension (not extant) between the Stephens Lane building and the William Street building required the demolition of (with possible incorporation of parts of) the 1865 brick building. The George Street wing was built by Thomas Hiron, who tendered  21,450, while the Stephens Lane infill building was constructed by J Maskrey, who tendered  2896.  The George Street wing was finished around mid 1912. \n The 1910 plans for the George Street wing were signed by  ,  , and by  , acting deputy Government Architect, while 1911 plans are signed by  , Deputy Government Architect. However, the design of the George Street wing has been attributed to  , a draughtsman who had assisted Thomas Pye with the design of the Executive Building, and who later became the State Government Architect for  .  Smith, also a painter, potter and sculptor, and an examiner in modelling for the  , designed the sculptures on the building. These include two freestanding devils on the parapet above the main entrance and a relief carved devil's head, directly above the entrance. Traditionally, devils are a symbol of the printing trade, generally accepted as representing printer's apprentices. \n These details were sculpted by well known Sydney sculptor,   who arrived in Sydney from Edinburgh in 1880 and from 1890 was Sydney's leading architectural sculptor. He received many commissions in New South Wales; his major work being the  . Macintosh arrived in Brisbane in 1903 to complete his major Queensland work, the Executive Building, and was also responsible for the sculptural details on the former  . \n The George Street wing connected with both the 1887 Stephens Lane building and the 1887 Lithographic Office, forming a \"U\" around the engine room. It was symmetrical, with the main entrance in the centre and secondary entrances and stair halls either side of the central section. There was an electric lift adjacent to each stair hall, and a basement. Whereas the roof of the Stephens Lane wing was supported on timber queen bolt trusses, the George Street wing used timber queen post trusses; and while cast iron columns had been used to support the main floor beams in the Stephens Lane wing, hardwood columns were used in the George Street wing.  It appears that the new building was considered a model for Government Printing Offices, as the   requested copies of the plan to assist in the design and extension of the Adelaide Printery building. \n Two storeys were also added to the engine room c.1910, and its use appears to have changed at this time to include a Sterro Room and workshop on the ground floor; men's and women's clubs, dining rooms and lavatories on the first floor; reading rooms on the second floor; and lavatories and toilets on the third floor. \n In 1910 plans the George Street wing's basement included stock rooms and a strong room; the ground floor (from the south-east to the north-west) contained an extension to the lithographic room (from the adjacent Lithographic Office), dispatch room, offices and a public counter; while the first floor contained another extension to the lithographic room plus bookbinding (an extension to the Stephens Lane wing's bookbinding floor). The second floor was used by compositors, in an extension of the function of the second floor of the Stephens Lane wing. \n By this time the William Street building had been reduced to secondary or service functions, including printing of railway tickets. The ground floor was a store, the first floor was used as a machine ruling room, and the second floor was the artists and process workroom. Around this time new windows were inserted to the top floor and new dormers were added to the roof (all since removed), and the toilets and lift at the end of the rear wing were demolished. From the end of the first floor rear verandah, a gallery ran to the former engine room and the Lithographic Office. \n In 1912 electricity was connected to all buildings on the site by the Edison and Swan United Electric Light Company Ltd. Various other improvements were made to the building over the years, including strengthening of the floors and installation of fire sprinklers.  By 1916 there were three small, one-storey buildings (stores and a workshop, not extant) in the corner of the complex, located between the William Street building and the Lithographic Office. Soon afterwards, the importance of the Government Printing Office in disseminating information to the public was demonstrated. In November 1917 the Australian military conducted a   on the Government Printing Office to seize copies of Hansard which the Federal Government did not wish circulated, as they covered debates in the Queensland Parliament on military censorship and the conscription issue. The military also temporarily took possession of the Government Printing Office in August 1918, this time to prevent coverage of statements made in the Queensland Parliament about the treatment of Irish and German internees. \n Changes to the site continued before and after World War II. In 1924 some of the roof slates of the William Street building were replaced with iron sheets, and more were replaced in 1933.  In 1952 toilets were built at the rear of William Street building, and in 1959 the Lithographic Office was extended towards the engine room and a concrete floor was laid to most of the ground floor of the Stephens Lane wing. In 1970 a new metal-clad building (not extant) was constructed south-west of the Lithographic Office, demolishing the c.1916 workshop. \n Meanwhile, the immediate post-war years of the late 1940s saw the Queensland Government begin to expand their activities considerably in Brisbane city. Most public servants were then located in the Treasury and Executive Buildings in George Street and in offices in Anzac Square. The shortage of office accommodation in the centre of Brisbane, and the need to address future requirements, led to a phase of governmental property acquisition in the city. The purchase of properties on George and William Streets between the Government Printing Office and Parliament House was a key focus, in addition to other acquisitions on Charlotte, Mary and Margaret Streets. \n The consolidation of government ownership and usage along George and William streets led to a number of schemes being investigated by the state to further the development of a \"government precinct\". By 1965, a masterplan had been developed that involved the demolition of all buildings between the old Executive Building and Parliament House, to enable the construction of three high-rise office buildings in a \"plaza setting\". However, only one of these was built between 1968 and 1971 a new Executive Building was constructed south-east of the Government Printing Office.  By the early 1970s the 1960s plan for the precinct was considered no longer suitable and a number of other proposals for the area were explored. \n A 1974 \"George Street Masterplan\" involved lower-rise buildings spread out over greater areas and the demolition of the   and  . A major influence in ultimately shaping the layout of the area during the 1970s was the growing community support for the retention of older buildings within the government precinct, especially the Belle Vue Hotel and the Mansions. Spearheaded by the National Trust, the government-related associations and links between buildings, their architectural qualities, and aesthetic contributions to the area were highlighted in submissions to the government and in the public sphere. The unannounced June 1974 removal of the balconies of the Belle Vue Hotel was a deliberate action by the State government to degrade the visual appearance of the area, and drew further attention to the conservation cause. \n In April 1979 Cabinet adopted a recommendation for a schedule of demolition work to further the development of the government precinct. The Belle Vue Hotel was to be demolished, but the Mansions and the original section of   were to be retained, renovated and adapted. On 21 April, three days after this decision, the Belle Vue Hotel was demolished in the early hours of the morning, a notorious event in the history of heritage conservation in Queensland. \n The Government Printing Office moved to new premises in   in October 1983, and a number of former Government Printing Office buildings were demolished in 1986\u20131987 to make way for a four-storey Executive Annex, connected to the 1971 Executive Building, and a four-level underground car park. The Lithographic Office, former engine room, the two remaining c. 1916 buildings, the 1970s building, the toilets at the rear of the William Street building and the Stephens Lane infill building were demolished. The construction of the car park under the site of the engine room and up to the south-east side and rear of the rear wing of the William Street building removed the remaining archaeological traces of the Commandant's cottage and kitchen with cellar, although the material was recorded by staff from the  .  The Commandant's cottage and kitchen wing are defined in outline by contrasting coloured bricks and sandstone in the new paving laid in 1987. The remaining section of the Commandant's cottage would have been under the footprint of the rear wing of the William Street building, but construction of a small basement (c. 1987) of reinforced concrete beneath the rear wing would have destroyed any surviving material. \n In 1989 the   moved into the William Street building, and prior restoration and renovation work undertaken in 1986\u20131988 included: the demolition of non-original dormer windows and restoration of the clerestory, reconstruction of the roof framing and replacement of the corrugated iron roofing with slate and galvanised steel sheeting, and reconstruction of the rear verandah. Removal, reconstruction or restoration of doors and windows took place, and some external openings were sealed, while some new windows and doors were inserted. The existing ground floor slab and flooring was replaced, along with sections of the front wing's timber flooring on the first and second floors. The rear wing's floors were replaced with reinforced concrete suspended slabs. Other strengthening of floors utilised steel beams and trusses, and all casements were replaced as pivot windows. \n The George Street/Stephens Lane building was renovated between 1987 and 1991 with work including: replacement roof sheeting, the formation of new walls where the Stephens Lane infill building and Lithographic Office had been demolished, construction of a glass-walled arcade on the south-east wall of the Stephens Lane wing, a tiered theatre at the south-east end of the second floor of the George Street wing, removal of the original lifts in the George Street wing and installation of two new lifts and toilets at the George Street end of the Stephens Lane wing, a new stairwell at the south-west end of the Stephens Lane wing, plus a light court extension from the basement to the courtyard and a link from the basement to the underground car park. \n The Sciencentre moved from the William Street building into the George Street/Stephens Lane building in 1992, from where it operated until 2002. In 1993 the William Street building's interior was remodelled for commercial use as the Public Services Club, and in 2005\u20132006 the George Street wing was refurbished for use by the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages, with a complete new fit-out and closure of the main entrance. \n The former Queensland Government Printing Office is sited within an important precinct of substantial masonry buildings built for other government uses. It comprises two separate buildings: one facing William Street, the other facing George Street, with a paved   between. The buildings have noticeably robust structural systems and open floor plans lit by many large windows. Stephens Lane (easement not road reserve) runs along the north-western side and, together with a cart lane (access route not road reserve) adjacent to the south-eastern elevation of the William Street building, provides access to the courtyard. The fronts of the buildings are more decorative than the rear and side elevations. \n The William Street building, located on the corner of William Street and Stephens Lane, is a three-storeyed building with a steeply pitched   clad with slate on the steep portion and rib and pan galvanised steel sheets on the shallow remainder. It is L-shaped, comprising a William Street wing and a rear wing around a fenced, paved rear courtyard accessible from the courtyard. The roof has a   of narrow, amber-coloured, fixed glazing at the change in pitch and lengths of cast iron ridge cresting. The building has a       and brick walls. The front and side walls are face brick while the rear walls are painted with areas of render where extensions have been demolished. Two brick   with distinctive shaped cappings are located at the Stephens Lane end of the building. \n The William Street   is primarily symmetrical with a ground floor   of five pointed arches between two slightly projecting  . Blind circular openings are located in the infills between each arch. The colonnade is reached via central stone  . Five sets of horizontal-pivot timber   align with the five arches of the colonnade. The entry is asymmetrical and located at the Stephens Lane end of the colonnade. The two end bays have stop-chamfered corners to the ground and first floors which are rendered and painted. Engaged   capped with foliated convex elements are located within the  . Each end bay has a centrally located segmental arch which surrounds a rendered section containing two   with semi-circular heads. The first floor levels have three similarly styled windows, symmetrically placed, and the second floor levels have larger scale windows which project above the   line and have curved  . A variety of bonds make up the brickwork, including  ,  , and  . The bricks of the William Street wing are discernibly better quality than those of the rear wing and have struck or ruled pointing. Carved sandstone   line the eaves. \n The Stephens Lane elevation is similar in detail to the front elevation, with rendered arches containing multiple lancet-type windows at ground floor level and a concave     over the first floor windows. The   of the front elevation continue around this elevation. \n The south-eastern cart lane is paved and the bricks on this face of the building are heavily scored and scratched from the passing of vehicles. \n The rear elevations are less decorative. A combination of arched and rectangular windows is used on all levels and a number of windows and doors at the rear of the building have been bricked in. A partially enclosed timber verandah is located on the north-west elevation of the rear wing. The courtyard garden is formed by modern steel partitions to enclose an outdoor seating area. \n The building is structurally composite. The entire ground floor is concrete slab with a   underneath the William Street wing and a small basement under the rear wing that connects to the underground car park behind the building. The remaining floors of the William Street are timber and those of the rear wing are concrete. The services including lifts, stairs, kitchens, cold rooms and toilets are located in the rear wing and are not of cultural heritage significance. The William Street wing comprises predominantly open spaces. \n The building has a rear entry into the rear wing that has become the main entrance. The ground and first floor levels of the William Street wing are similar in design, with original joinery, iron columns, and exposed rafters and beams. Walls are rendered and painted. The William Street wing is partitioned on ground level into three rooms, each with a fireplace. The rooms retain finely detailed joinery and ceilings are beaded   timber board ceilings with timber  . Generally, the building retains early and original door and window hardware. \n The second floor of the William Street wing is notable for its exposed roof structure comprising multiple sets of     with unusual   detailing and  . Members are stop-chamfered. The ceiling comprises beaded boarding laid diagonally and is raked to follow the  . The roof members and ceiling are stained dark brown. The amber-coloured glass in the   is also used in the top of windows to William Street and Stephens Lane. The walls are bagged and painted brick. Elements not of cultural heritage significance in the building include: post-1983 elements such as the basement, the escape stair at the junction of the two wings, the partitions and suspended ceilings in the rear wing, any replica cast iron columns not in their original positions, steel strengthening of the roof framing, the rear verandahs, reconstructed chimney sections, air conditioning ducts, and the modern fit-out and joinery. \n The George Street building is a substantial brick building of three storeys and a partial basement forming an L-shape around a rear courtyard. One wing of the building fronts George Street and the other fronts Stephens Lane and both have slightly different structural systems. The George Street wing has timber floor and roof framing supported by large timber columns with timber bolsters. The Stephens Lane wing has a concrete floor to the ground floor and timber floor and roof framing supported by cast iron columns. \n The George Street facade is symmetrically composed around a central, slightly projecting entrance bay with wings both side terminating in a pavilion. It is in a  . The facade is primarily smooth rendered above a rusticated porphyry base and the entrance bay and two subsidiary entrances are sandstone. The facade comprises many square headed windows with square-formed string courses. Decorative features are primarily restricted to the ground floor and include rendered details and carved stonework. \n The entrance bay has a rusticated base of granite and an arch leads to an inset   with stairs up to the entrance doors. These doors are timber with   panels and   depicting various printing techniques. Above the arch is a relief carved devil's face and banners with the words \"PRINTING OFFICE\" and the date \"1910\". A large   separates the ground level from the upper two levels which have double   rising through both levels on either side of windows. The pilasters have     with the faces of devils between the   and the two sets of windows are double hung and have   in front of them. The pilasters support a broken-bed   with   to the   featuring the  . Above the pediment is a   with   at either end supporting sculpted stone devils holding shields bearing the  . \n The Stephens Lane and rear elevations reflect the subsidiary and functional nature of the lane frontage and \"back of house\" conditions. A lightly rusticated porphyry base supports painted brick walls with many square headed windows. The rear elevations of the two wings are face brick but of discernibly different bricks on either wing. The Stephens Lane wing has dark brown face brick laid in English bond with segmental arches of red brick over the windows. The windows are two paned casement windows and the sills are either painted stone or rendered. The ground level is an   of arched openings forming a covered walkway with a glazed wall forming the enclosure to the interior offices. \n The rear elevation of the George Street wing is in red face brick in an English bond with lighter red brick headers. The windows are two paned double hung timber   with stone  . The first and second floors have a   that extends the length of the building and curves to provide access into the Stephens Lane wing. It has a cast iron   and is supported by cast iron brackets. The same brackets support the extended eaves to the second level. \n Access to the George Street wing is from the rear courtyard. The original entrance from George Street is sealed and a new glass partition and door of recent construction are located directly in front of these internally. The interior spaces are large with high ceilings. The Stephens Lane wing has timber tongue and groove ceilings and the George Street wing has ripple iron ceilings on the ground and first floors and timber boards on the second floor. Walls are either plastered and painted, or sandblasted brick. The building has four ventilated and glazed  ; three in the Stephens Lane wing and one large one in the George Street wing. \n To either side of the now-disused George Street entrance are offices with partitions of     and maple and clear glazing above. The main doors into these areas also have stained glass panels and the remainder have   panels with lettering designating the office use. Ceilings and   in these areas are  . Post-1983 elements not of cultural heritage significance include: reconstructed walls at the south end of the Stephens Lane wing and the east end of the George Street wing, the link to the Executive Annex, modern partitions and fit-out, and new work in the basement. \n The courtyard between the two buildings is planted with   and forms the roof of a four-storey underground concrete car park which is not of cultural heritage significance. Other elements within the cultural heritage boundary which have no cultural heritage significance include the stone capping to the wall along Stephens Lane; the modern fabric of the courtyard garden of the Public Services Club, on the site of the 1865 building; the light well to the basement of the George Street wing; and vents to the underground car park. Adjacent to the William Street building and also fronting William Street is the Executive Annexe, a four-storey concrete building that is not of cultural heritage significance. \n The former Queensland Government Printing Office was listed on the   on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. \n \n The Queensland Government Printing Office was the first purpose-built government printery in Queensland and operated on the site from 1862 to 1983, playing an essential part in the administration of Queensland for 121 years. The dissemination of Hansard and other government information is an important part of democracy, promoting public access to parliamentary debate and facilitating transparency regarding government decisions. The expansion of the site and addition of new buildings over time was a result of the growth of the Queensland Government and its functions. \n As part of a government precinct that has existed since 1825, the place helps to demonstrate the early importance of this part of Brisbane to the administration of the Moreton Bay penal settlement and later the colony and state of Queensland. The proximity of the printing office to Parliament is also a reflection of its important role in government. \n The former Government Printing Office buildings fit within a pattern of substantial, well designed masonry buildings constructed to the designs of colonial and government architects. The structures show an adaption to Queensland's climate and the increased availability of materials and skills over time, including improvements in brick manufacturing processes. The designs of the constituent buildings also demonstrate the increased ambitiousness of the projects of the Colonial/Government Architect's Office between the 1870s and the 1910s. \n The survival of the main Government Printing Office buildings, despite 1960s plans for the demolition of the complex, demonstrates how increased public concern about the preservation of heritage buildings influenced government redevelopment plans during the 1970s and 1980s. \n \n The former Queensland Government Printing Office was the only government printing office in Queensland from 1862 to 1983. \n \n The place has the potential to reveal information that will contribute to our understanding of Queensland's history. There is the potential for sub-surface material to survive relating to the first printing office (1862), particularly the foundations, as well as material relating to the 1865 building, including an underground cistern and associated stables. \n \n Located within a government precinct, the buildings of the former Queensland Government Printing Office continue to demonstrate the principal characteristics of a nineteenth-/early twentieth-century printing office. The interiors have good natural lighting and ventilation and are plain and robust compared to the more elaborate street appearance. The buildings feature smaller, more finely detailed administration areas supporting large production areas and substantial structural framing provides unobstructed floor areas and allows for heavy floor loadings. Access to the rear of the buildings was provided, at different times, via Stephens Lane and the cart lane south-east of the Williams Street building. \n The use of brick walls, as well as the use of slate on the William Street building's roof, demonstrates the precautions taken against the threat of fire, while the skylights on the top floor of the Stephens Lane/George Street building demonstrates the compositors' need for good natural light. \n The carved Queensland crest, printers' devils, and leaded stained glass with images of the printing process on the George Street wing are also indications of the place's former status and use. At the time of construction, the design of the 1910\u20131912 George Street wing was considered to be a model for other state printing offices. \n The William Street building is a good example of the work of the Colonial Architect, Francis Drummond Greville Stanley, while the George Street wing of the Government Printing Office is an excellent example of the work of Edwin Evan Smith, a draughtsman in the Government Architect's Office, and the Sydney sculptor William P Macintosh. \n \n The former Queensland Government Printing Office is an integral part of the most prominent and cohesive group of government buildings in Queensland. A major landmark in the city of Brisbane, together with the former Treasury Building, former Land Administration Building, and Queens Gardens situated between William and George Streets, the former Government Printing Office contributes to both streetscapes. Other buildings in the group include the former State Library, former Commissariat Stores and the former Department of Primary Industries Building on William Street; and the former Family Services Building on George Street. Unified by quality design, materials, form, finish and workmanship, this group of visually cohesive buildings dominate the southern edge of the central business district, adjacent to the north bank of the Brisbane River. The view down, and access along, Stephens Lane enhances the visual appreciation of the former Government Printing Office and former Land Administration Building. \n The buildings within the complex display a high degree of design and workmanship internally and externally. The 1872\u20131874 William Street building is differentiated within the precinct by its distinctively steeply pitched roof form, awnings, arcade and dark face-brickwork skilfully relieved with stone detailing. The 1887 Stephens Lane building and its 1910\u20131912 George Street wing share a uniformity and convention in scale symmetry and classical detailing with the other George Street government buildings. The detailing of the George Street entrance with sculpted stone printers' devils over the entry is of particular aesthetic value. \n \n The site has a long and close association with the Queensland Government Printing Office, a department which played an important role in the administration of Queensland through its dissemination of government information to the public. \n  This Wikipedia article was originally based on   published by the   under   licence (accessed on 7 July 2014,   on 8 October 2014).

Section 404  of the Act requires permits for the discharge of dredged or fill materials into \"navigable waters,\" which is defined by the Act as \"waters of the United States.\" That provision was the basis for the federal  -permitting program.\n The Court held that the use of the   of the long-controversial \" ,\" adopted by the Corps and   (EPA) to interpret the reach of its Section 404 authority over discharges into \"isolated waters\" (including isolated wetlands), exceeded the authority that was granted by that section. \n Long before the   case, there had been controversy and litigation over whether isolated waters that are not adjacent to true navigable waters are properly within the jurisdiction of Section 404.  In 1985, the Supreme Court sustained the assertion by the Corps and EPA that waters and wetlands adjacent to navigable waters, interstate waters, or their tributaries are \"waters of the United States\" under Section 404. The question left for   was whether waters and wetlands not so adjacent, \"isolated waters,\" are also so covered.\n SWANCC, a consortium of  -area cities and villages, sought to develop  landfill for baled nonhazardous solid waste ( ) on a 533-acre (2.16\u00a0km ) parcel in  . The parcel had been used for sand and gravel mining until about 1960. Since then, the excavation trenches from the mining had evolved into ponds ranging in size from a 'few feet across to several acres. SWANCC obtained the needed local and state permits, but the Corps, on the basis of the ponds and their use by migratory birds, asserted jurisdiction under section 404 and denied a permit.\n Section 404 requires permits for discharges to dispose of dredged and fill material into the nation's navigable waters, such as when a landowner undertakes activity to develop or otherwise improve his or her property. To assess whether this requirement applies to a particular activity, a landowner must determine whether the disposal site is a \"water of the United States\" within CWA jurisdiction. The definitions of waters subject to CWA jurisdiction are contained in regulations of the Corps of Engineers and EPA, the agencies with primary responsibility for administering section 404.  Through judicial interpretation and regulatory changes since the 1970s, the types of regulated waters have evolved from narrow to broad, and also to include wetlands. Congress has not amended section 404 since 1977, when it provided regulatory exemptions for categories of routine activities, such as normal farming and forestry.\n The SWANCC site ponds are known in section 404 parlance as \"isolated waters\"- waters that are not traditionally navigable or interstate, nor tributaries thereof, nor adjacent to any of these. In 1985, the Supreme Court in   upheld the Corps' authority under section 404 to regulate wetlands (and other waters) adjacent to navigable and interstate waters, and their tributaries.  It expressly left open the question, however, whether isolated waters, not being adjacent, lie within the reach of section 404, or, for that matter, within Congress' power under the   of the  .  Both before and after Riverside Bayview, the lower courts have wrestled with these questions.\n The Corps' assertion of jurisdiction over the isolated waters at the SWANCC site, as elsewhere, was based on a three-step argument. First, section 404 applies by its terms to \"  waters,\" defined expansively by the CWA to mean \"the waters of the United States.\"  Second, under 1977 regulations the Corps defines \"waters of the United States\" broadly to include, in addition to traditionally navigable waters, interstate waters, their tributaries, and adjacent wetlands, the following -\n [all] other waters such as intrastate lakes, rivers,   streams (including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie   potholes,  , playa lakes, or natural ponds, the use, degradation, or destruction   of which could affect interstate commerce \n Third, the Corps'  , a 1986 attempt by the agency to clarify the intrastate waters covered by this regulation, says that such \"isolated waters\" include those \"which are or would be used as habitat by ... migratory birds that cross state lines ...\"  The Corps had found that the water areas on the SWANCC site are used as habitat by migratory birds that cross state lines.\n In reading its section 404 jurisdiction broadly, the Corps was not without congressional support. In defining \"navigable waters\" as \"waters of the United States,\" Congress \"evidently intended to repudiate limits that had been placed on federal regulation by earlier water pollution control federal statutes ...\"   Indeed, the conference report accompanying enactment of the CWA in 1972 states that \"[t]he conferees fully intend that the term 'navigable waters' be given the broadest possible constitutional interpretation ...' \n The district court granted summary judgment to the Corps of Engineers on the jurisdictional issue.  On appeal, the   ruled in favor of Corps jurisdiction as well.  The Seventh Circuit found that Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution  to regulate isolated waters, and that Congress, in enacting section 404, intended to reach such waters. The Supreme Court reversed.\n The   ruling saw the Court divide 5-4. The five-justice majority opinion, in one reading, concluded only that the Corps and EPA could not continue to use the migratory bird rule to assert section 404 jurisdiction over isolated waters. \"We conclude,\" said the Court at one point, that the 'Migratory Bird Rule' is not fairly supported by the CWA.\"  The decision's rationale, however, was broader, appearing to preclude federal assertion of section 404 jurisdiction over isolated waters on any basis. Stated the Court: \"In order to rule for [the Corps], we would have to hold that the jurisdiction of the Corps extends to ponds that are not adjacent to open water. But we conclude that the text of the statute will not allow this.\" \n The Court deemed it unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue pressed by SWANCC: whether the EPA's interpretation of the CWA exceeded the power of Congress, under the Commerce Clause.\n The majority opinion, written by  , held that Congress, in enacting the 1977 amendments to the CWA, had not implicitly approved the Corps' broad definition of \"navigable water\" adopted that year  under the original 1972 CWA. For example, Congress' failure to pass a bill in 1977 containing a narrow definition of navigable waters had not been shown by the Corps, said the majority, to constitute congressional approval of the Corps' broad definition. The majority then declined to afford the Corps the customary deference granted agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. For one thing, it said that section 404 is not ambiguous at all. Even if it were, deference is not appropriate where an agency interpretation of a statute \"invokes the outer limits of Congress' power,\" a reference to the Court's milestone decisions in recent years involving the reach of the Commerce Clause. That concern is particularly strong, it said, where the agency interpretation permits encroachment on a traditional state power, in this case land and water use.\n The dissent, written by  , stated that given  , holding that the CWA went beyond navigable waters to embrace marshes and adjacent inland lakes would extend the CWA indefinitely. The 1972 CWA, in the dissent's view, offers no support for such a constraint, and the 1977 CWA amendment supports coverage of isolated waters. Moreover, the dissent declares that there is no Commerce Clause problem since the discharge of dredged and fill materials into \"waters of the United States\" is an economic activity that may be aggregated to show a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\n Estimates of waters and wetland acreage likely to be removed from the section 404 permitting program as a result of the   decision are very difficult to assess, in part because of questions about Corps and EPA interpretation of the ruling, but the decision may affect up to 79% of wetland acreage. One likely result is that case-by-case evaluations will then be required to determine if regulatory jurisdiction exists, the length of time to obtain section 404 permits will be longer than in the past. If federal jurisdiction is diminished, the responsibility to protect affected wetlands falls on states and local governments. A comprehensive picture of their ability to protect wetlands, under various possible state and local authorities, is difficult to draw together. Whether states will act to fill in the gap left by removal of some federal jurisdiction by new laws or programs raises difficult political and resource questions.\n The   decision also raises issues for Congress. One is whether confusion that may now exist about the extent of Clean Water Act jurisdictional waters and wetlands should be resolved, as well as what constitutional limits may apply. Another is whether to provide federal resources and incentives to encourage expansion of state wetlands protection and regulatory programs or others that encourage acquisition and conservation of wetlands.\n In 2001, the   decision continued the efforts of the five Supreme Court justices generally regarded as conservative to limit federal regulatory power. In 1995 and 2000, the same five justices found that Congress had exceeded Commerce Clause limits in enacting legislation dealing with   and  .  To be sure, the Supreme Court in   did not reach the constitutional question, but rather disposed of the case on purely statutory grounds. Nonetheless, its analysis of the CWA has, as noted, a strong undercurrent of the same Commerce Clause and federalism concerns. In not addressing the constitutional issue, SWANCC resembles another recent Commerce Clause decision in which, as in  , the Court used the possibility of Commerce Clause issues being raised by a broad interpretation of a federal statute to support its adoption of a narrow reading.  The Court did not grant a petition for certiorari in a similar Commerce Clause challenge to the  . \n The problem underlying the   decision arises largely from the history of some jurisdictional terms used by Congress in water-related statutes. In the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, Congress set the scope of many such statutes as the \"navigable waters\" of the United States.This made sense because Congress was focused on fostering waterborne commerce, and the Supreme Court had obliged by articulating a broad vision of federal power over navigation. A prominent example, and a forerunner of the CWA, was the  , particularly its section 13 known as the \"Refuse Act.\"  With the shift in emphasis in the mid-20th century from protection of navigation to protection of the environment, however, the phrase \"navigable waters\" was no longer a comfortable fit. Notwithstanding, Congress used \"navigable waters\" in 1972 when it wrote the CWA, including section 404, accommodating the broader concerns of environmental protection by defining \"navigable waters\" expansively to mean \"waters of the United States.\" The question in   was whether this definition entirely removed the \"navigable\" qualifier from the Act or merely limited it. The justices in the majority opted for the latter and were unwilling to go beyond the erosion of that qualifier that had already been accepted by the Court in  . \n s implications for the scope of the federal wetlands permitting program are certain to be significant, but it will take years of litigation before they are fully clear. A key source of confusion is the aforementioned disconnect between the decision's narrow holding and broad rationale. The latter appears to preclude any effort by the Corps to assert jurisdiction over isolated waters, including isolated wetlands, on the basis of linkages with interstate commerce other than the interstate flight of migratory birds. (The Corps asserted such non-migratory-bird linkages after the litigation commenced, noting that  s municipal landfill is clearly of a commercial nature and, when aggregated with similar activity elsewhere, would substantially affect interstate commerce. The Supreme Court declined to consider this argument, pointing out that landfill activity is a \"far cry\" from the \"waters of the United States\" to which the CWA extends.) Plainly, the degree of section 404 program contraction occasioned by   will depend on which aspects of the decision shape the government's response.\n On that point, a legal memorandum issued by the Corps and EPA on January 19, 2001,  stays more closely to the narrow holding but in tentative terms. The memorandum notes the above-discussed difference between the   rationale and holding, and takes a case-by-case approach as to the waters falling within the coverage gap (last item below). In summary, the memorandum asserts:\n \u2022 Traditionally navigable waters, interstate waters, their tributaries, and wetlands adjacent to each are still covered. \n\u2022 Intrastate waters that could affect interstate commerce solely by virtue of their use as habitat for migratory birds are no longer covered. \n\u2022 As to intrastate waters having other (non-migratory bird) connections to interstate commerce, staff is advised to consult agency legal counsel. For example, waters that are isolated and intrastate but nonetheless navigable (such as the   in Utah)   may still support jurisdiction \"if their use, degradation, or destruction could   affect interstate or foreign commerce.\"\n The guidance goes on to state its view that the   holding, while important, is \"limited,\" and must be interpreted in light of other Supreme Court precedents \"which... broadly uphold CWA jurisdictional authority.\" \n Another source of uncertainty for the wetlands permitting program will be the extent to which, lacking any clear authority over isolated waters now, the Corps may seek to recharacterize wetlands from that category to ones over which its section 404 authority remains undisputed. For example, the concept of traditionally-navigable waters is an elastic one, covering all waters that are now navigable, were once navigable, or could reasonably be made navigable in the future.  Another example is the \"adjacent wetlands\" jurisdiction upheld in  . One might think the concept of adjacency to be relatively clear, but in   itself, the wetlands in question were only \"near\" the shores of the lake, \"part o/a wetland that actually abuts on a navigable waterway.\"  The Court expressly noted that the concept of adjacent wetlands includes those adjacent wetlands \"that are not the result of flooding or permeation by water having its source in adjacent bodies of water,\"  approving the Corps' view that wetlands may affect the water quality of adjacent waterbodies by functioning as integral parts of the same aquatic environment.\n By interpreting the scope of \"waters of the United States\" as used in section 404,   will affect the scope of other CWA sections whose jurisdictional scope is defined by that same phrase. Such sections include those governing oil spill cleanup (section 311), the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program (section 402), and state water quality certification (section 401).\n Since the Court's actual holding concerning CWA regulation was narrow, while its rationale was wider ranging (as discussed above), the policy implications of how much the   decision restricts federal regulation depend on how broadly or narrowly the opinion is applied. Two scenarios are possible. A broad reading would be interpreted as knocking out all section 404 jurisdiction and Corps regulation of isolated waters and wetlands. However, a narrow reading, one asserting that jurisdiction will be found lacking only if the sole connection to interstate commerce is the presence of migratory birds and wildlife, would allow federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue (such as in waters that are used by interstate travelers for recreation).\n The question of which view the government would take was answered in a January 19 memorandum issued jointly by EPA and the Corps for headquarters and field/regional staff who work on the section 404 program, discussed above; the agencies provide a legal interpretation, based on a narrow reading of the Court's decision.\n A key policy question that may not be clearly answered for some time is how regulatory protection of wetlands will be affected or reduced as a result of the decision. Many types of isolated wetlands are not physically adjacent to navigable waters and under a broad reading of the decision, would lack regulation. Major wetland types that potentially would not be regulated include prairie potholes of the Upper Midwest,  , river fringing wetlands along small non-navigable rivers and streams, lake fringing wetlands for smaller non-navigable lakes, many forested wetlands, playas and vernal ponds of Texas and other areas of the west, seeps and spring, flats, bogs and large amounts of tundra in Alaska. A new report by the Department of Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that in 1997, there were 105,500,000 acres (427,000\u00a0km ) of wetlands on public and private lands in the conterminous United States and that between 1986 and 1997, a net of 644,000 acres (2,610\u00a0km ) of wetlands was lost.  According to an analysis prepared by the Association of State Wetland Managers (ASWM), accurate estimates of impacts of the decision on wetland resources are not possible, in part because of uncertainty about how key terms in the opinion (such as \"adjacent\" and \"tributary\") will be defined, whether broadly or narrowly. Still, ASWM believes that impacts are likely to be environmentally significant.\n Tentative state estimates which have been provided to the Association of State Wetland Managers suggest 30% to 79% of total wetland acreage may be   affected.... Even if SWANCC results in only a one percent loss of America's wetlands, the decision would cause more wetlands to be destroyed than were lost in the past decade. \n Scientists recognize the value of wetlands on the basis of a range of physical functions that they perform. One group of functions relates to water quality. Wetlands are good water filters: they remove and retain nutrients, they process chemical and organic wastes, and they reduce sediment loads to receiving waters. Wetlands also provide flood damage protection to urban and agricultural lands by storing flood waters that overflow river banks or surface waters and by collecting waters in isolated depressions. Wetlands recharge groundwater reserves that are hydrological: connected to surface waters. According to a 1995 National Research Council report, many of these functions occur irrespective of whether the wetlands are isolated or contiguous to navigable waters because of groundwater connections between isolate) wetlands and surface waters. Small, shallow wetlands that are isolated from rivers are frequently important to waterfowl, the NRC said, for food and forage. Also, sites that are intermittently flooded, even those that may be completely dry for several years, can be important for storing flood waters and can have distinctive water-dependent biota (plants and animals) that persist over dry intervals but return when water return to the site. \n The   decision affects not only privately owned lands but also isolated waters and wetlands on  : the federal government owns about one- third of the nation's lands. As a result of the Court's decision, federal agency decisions on these lands affecting isolated wetlands will no longer be subject to section 404 permitting, but they will still be subject to requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and Executive Orders dealing with wetlands, floodplain management, and protection of migratory birds.\n In addition to the section 404 program, questions arise about impacts of the   ruling on other parts of the CWA, especially its principal permit program, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program under section 402. It requires permits for pollutant discharges from point sources (industrial facilities and municipal sewage plants) into the nation's waters. Another provision, section 311, concerns liability for oil discharges into the nation's waters. Neither was at issue in this case but might be challenged through extension of the ruling. The January 19 joint Corps-EPA memorandum states that federal implementation of any other CWA provision that involves \"waters of the United States\" will be governed by the same interpretation that applies to section 404. As a result, federal jurisdiction to require NPDES permits or assess oil spill liability in some isolated waters could be limited. Such impacts will become clearer in time.\n As noted previously, prior to  , virtually all US wetlands were, at least theoretically, subject to regulation under section 404. As federal jurisdiction is diminished, the responsibility to protect affected wetlands falls on states primarily and local governments, which also regulate some wetlands. State and local wetlands regulatory programs focus primarily upon navigable waters, tributaries, and adjacent wetlands. They supplement but do not substitute for federal jurisdiction. According to the Association of State Wetland Managers (ASWM),  14 states have some form of regulatory program for freshwater wetlands, but they are quite variable. Differences exist in part because freshwater wetland types vary greatly across the nation and because of differing state preferences. Some of the state programs are very comprehensive, but regulations in many of the 14 states are limited by wetland size, mapping requirements, and exemptions for specified activities. According to ASWM, state regulations do not generally apply to federal lands. Some of the states with the largest isolated wetland acreages provide little or no state protection, including  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .\n Changes in section 404 jurisdiction would diminish use of one tool used by many states to control activities affecting wetlands. In recent years, most states have used CWA section 401 water quality certification programs in addition to or in lieu of specific regulatory statutes. Section 401 requires that before a federal permit or license is issued, states must certify that the project complies with water quality standards. That authority effectively gives states a veto power on the federal permit or the ability to require conditions that become part of a permit. State water quality certification has been used by a number of states to control activities affecting wetlands without having to independently establish state permitting and enforcement programs. However, if federal jurisdiction does not exist and no section 404 or other federal permit is required, section 401 certification also is not required and so is not available as a tool for the state to evaluate the proposed activity.\n A number of states without wetlands laws on their books still have other state environmental laws dealing with water quality or natural resources, and they may already provide substantial authority to regulate wetlands.  However, a comprehensive picture of states' ability to protect wetlands, under various possible authorities, is difficult to draw together. To fill in the gap left by removal of some federal regulatory jurisdiction, states could adopt more comprehensive wetlands regulatory statutes or wetland amendments to state pollution control statutes (possibly including independent water quality certification programs) and rules. The latter, for example, could integrate wetlands, water quality, and watershed management. States do not have the constitutional constraints that the federal government does in enacting legislation (whether a legislative action exceeds Congress' power under the Commerce Clause). Also, CWA section 404(t) expressly provides that the existence of section 404 does not preempt state law governing the discharge of dredged or fill material. However, whether states will take steps to expand wetlands protection in response to the Court's decision raises difficult political and resource questions. It is quite likely that, among states, the SWANCC decision pleases some states and is opposed by others.\n Some of the issues left open by   were resolved by the Supreme Court's subsequent ruling in  .  In  , the Court further narrowed the scope of the term \"waters of the United States,\" which \"include[] only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water 'forming geographic features' that are described in ordinary parlance as 'streams[,] ... oceans, rivers, [and] lakes.'\" \n \u00a0This article incorporates   from  \n"},

He was born in  , Australia, to Greek parents.\n Papadopoulos started his professional career with   in 2003 after stepping up from the Aris Youth with another promising attacking youngster, his friend Ethimios Pantelidis. Before, he had been with Digenis Lakkomatos Chalkidiki youth.\n At the beginning of his career, he started as a striker or attacking midfielder. In the period between 2003 and summer 2006, Aris lived some darker days of their history in Greek football also tangled with a defensive philosophy of football, financial problems in the club, Papadopoulos experienced some gradual \"demotions\" into the more defensive positions by his coaches. Firstly into defensive midfielder, then also right back and finally central defender.\n He is quite tall, with very tough body constitution, but not slow for his physical appearance, with pretty good awareness and tackling, sometimes reckless which leads him to getting yellow cards, but also this can be partially explained by more attacking football of the post-2006 Aris that can expose a defender like Papadopoulos to the situations of must-break the opponents' attacks. The scorer of several goals through his career generally by his strong headers and penalties. The best example is his only goal/header in the final qualifiers with   in the   group stage at the   stadium, which, at the end of the day, turned out to be the crucial and historic goal after Aris' loss 2\u20131 in Spain that ensured Aris the progression to the group stage. Yet he has been sent up in front, whenever Aris needed an extra striker in the dying minutes of matches. \n As an \"Aris kid\" playing for his beloved club, but also with the fact that he experienced dark days as well as lighter, he was one of the fans' favourites logically, also one of the \"last Mohicans\" in the club (\"Mohicans\"- figuratively related to the players as  ,  , Papadopoulos,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , that were with this team in the  , season 2005/06, as well as the season's after that, when the club experienced its promotion and then a total rebirth in the first division with good football and higher standing positions). Aris' number 4 was also known for his passion. For many years' transfer windows he used to be linked to Athenian giants (especially  ) by media/usually the sports news-papers, but yet had never changed his club, by then. Also as stories were circulating during the season (2006/07), he had been watched closely by some bigger clubs' scouts like   or  , and   of Russia as well.

That act, which took its culmination right after he accepted to join  , caused many Aris fans to rage at him pronouncing the same as a traitor to them. \n On 4 July 2008 the player was transferred to   for 2.5 million euros on a four-year contract. Avraam stated this during a press conference, \" \".\n Papadopoulos made his debut against   in a 3\u20130 away loss. He finished 2008\u201309 season with 22 league matches. He started the next season by scoring against   in a 0\u20132 away win. This was his first goal for Olympiacos. He managed to score a crucial goal against   in a 1\u20132 away win. He also scored against   in a 1\u20132 home loss. He completed 28 league appearances and he scored 2 goals. His partnership with   at the centre of defence played a vital role for Olympiacos as they won back-to-back championships in the   and   seasons.\n On 24 June 2011 he was accused by the Athens prosecutor for his alleged involvement in match-fixing, as the list of those implicated in the scandal that has rocked Greek football grew. Papadopoulos, who plays for champions Olympiacos, was also included in the list along with another high profile player,  , who is on the books of Aris.

The 29-year-old was club captain for the Greek champions and had been a pivotal figure since joining in 2008. However, his last season saw   break into the first-team and Papadopoulos became a somewhat peripheral figure at the Karaiskakis Stadium. The Greece international took the time to praise Olympiacos president Evangelos Marinakis, but revealed that his relationship with Spanish coach Michel was beyond repair after completing his move to Turkey.   said Papadopoulos in an open letter on the club's official website. \n On 1 September 2014 Trabzonspor landed the former Greek international from Olympiacos. Papadopoulos was set to be the center of fans attention, with the veteran midfielder becoming only the second Greek player to play in Turkey's top-flight, following  . \n On 23 January 2015 Trabzonspor transferred Papadopoulos to   for \u20ac285,000, he signed a contract until 30 December 2016.

Her original   and central   were removed and a new bridge and accommodation was built in the  , as with all other lake freighters. Her engines were left midships, and the second superstructure, that other lake freighters had above their engines, in the stern was built above her engines in their midship locations. Her hull was lengthened by 165 feet (50\u00a0m).  But unlike every other lake freighter she still had   abaft her engine rooms.\n She was towed from the yard where she was converted, in  ,   to  ,  , and special provisions had to be made so she could travel under the bridges she encountered.

It is run by   under its  .  The channel primarily airs animated programming.\n The channel initially launched on 17 September 1993 as a larger pan-European feed, serving the UK market along with Western and Northern Europe.  In August 1999, the pan-European aspect of Cartoon Network Europe was spun-off as a new feed with an identical schedule to Cartoon Network UK (the former pan-European feed).  Cartoon Network UK completely ceased being a pan-European feed on 15 October 1999, which was when it was scrambled with Videocrypt and the launch of the UK only version of TNT. The pan-European feed continued to shadow Cartoon Network UK's schedule until 2001. The pan-European feed excluded shows such as   and   and were substituted, as Cartoon Network did not have the pan-European broadcasting rights to these shows, only the rights for the UK and the Netherlands. \n In October 1992, the   was launched at  ,  ,  . Cartoon Network was created in response of Turner Entertainment acquiring  's animation library in 1986 and the acquisition of the   animation studio and cartoon library in 1991. As a result of Turner purchasing MGM's Cartoon and Film library, Warner Bros. pre-1948 content was also acquired, including early   and   shorts.  At launch in the United States, Cartoon Network had an 8,500-hour cartoon library,  and it became the first channel dedicated to cartoons. In April 1993, Cartoon Network expanded into foreign markets by launching a   version of Cartoon Network dubbed in both Spanish, Portuguese and English. Cartoon Network's large animation library was in high demand in Western Europe  and as a response to consumer demand,  , the satellite on which Cartoon Network broadcast on, was launched in May 1993 on board an   rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. Cartoon Network Europe was launched on 17 September 1993, broadcasting from London. It launched only less than 12 months after the original American version and only 16 days after  . \n Cartoon Network originally timeshared with   and broadcast from 5:00AM until 7:00PM,  with TNT broadcast during the channel\u2019s downtime from 7:00PM to 5:00AM. Sunday afternoons saw \"Super Chunk\", which showed back to back episodes of one show for two hours between 1 pm and 3 pm.  Another feature was \"The Longest Day\", in which Cartoon Network ran for an extra four hours until 11:00PM in June 1994, every year beginning in 1994.  This slot was dedicated to full-length cartoon movies. The first theme was the   theme, which showed graphics from its US counterpart and lasted until 1999. The Checkerboard branding package was developed by Hatmaker Studios,  now merged and part of its sister company - Corey, McPherson and Nash.  Also unlike Nickelodeon, which was part of  , Cartoon Network was   across Europe. \n In September 1996, Cartoon Network began running for an extra two hours until 9:00PM, and in December 1996,  along with TNT, it became a 24-hour channel. The full time version was only available on the   satellite as the timesharing version of the channel continued to appear on analogue platforms, including on all providers in the UK.   In December 1998, Cartoon Network launched as part of the   satellite platform on the   satellite.  Also, in February 1997, Dutch cable provider A2000/KTA added the 24-hour Cartoon Network and TNT channels to its programming lineup. \n From 15 November 1998, Cartoon Network was part of  's channel package, airing 24 hours a day until the service collapsed on 1 May 2002. \n In October 1999, Cartoon Network officially split from the pan-European feed, this was when the shared transponder analogue feed on Astra 1C became scrambled with   and when the short-lived analogue UK and Ireland only version of TNT launched. Prior to this date, the European version of Cartoon Network moved to   to serve Central Europe in August 1999 and the French and Spanish version launched at the same time the same month, leaving the ex pan-European version on Astra 1C acting as a de facto free to air secondary/transitional European feed for countries preparing to switchover to their own newly launched local versions of Cartoon Network up until encryption in October 1999. TNT changed its programming from classic movies to general entertainment as the movies were moved to TCM, TNT UK ceased to exist in July 2000 and was replaced by an analogue version of TCM. During the late 90s and the early 2000s, Turner Entertainment Networks International started localising their channels to suit different audiences across different countries around Europe, Middle East and Africa.\n After the pan-European split, Cartoon Network revamped on 15 October 1999 with the launch of a unique and more intensive variant of the \"Powerhouse\" theme which had shapes and tiles with lines and footage of characters from various shows shown on Cartoon Network. This lasted until 1 September 2002 in the UK and was used throughout Europe on 30 September 2002. The European version of Powerhouse was produced by now-defunct London based animation and design studio AMGFX.  A DJ theme was used during the   programming block, bumpers include a live-action DJ scratching a record, which affects the playback of a cartoon clip. \n On 30 June 2001, the analogue feed on Astra 1C of Cartoon Network and TCM ceased broadcasting. Sky's analogue service would later fully shut down on 27 September that year. \n On 11 April 2005, after it was introduced in the United States, Cartoon Network adopted the CN City era until 23 May 2007.\n On 24 May 2007, Cartoon Network changed its branding to a similar look to ones used during 1999 to 2005, this branding was known as the Arrow Era. There were also alternate Arrow Era idents designed by the design studio, Stardust, which had a 3D style, rather than the 2D style used by the other Arrow Era idents. The British and Irish version of Cartoon Network used both 2D and 3D Arrow Era idents, while other Cartoon Network channels that used the Arrow Era usually either used only one. This branding lasted until 26 September 2010. \n On 27 September 2010, the British version of Cartoon Network introduced its current branding and logo while Cartoon Network Too continued to use the Arrow era until 2012 and the 2004 logo was still used as the network's production logo until 24 May 2007. Designed by Brand New School, it makes heavy use of a black and white checkerboard motif, as well as various CMYK colour variations and patterns. This branding had been introduced earlier in the American version on 29 May 2010.  The DOG was moved from the top right corner to the bottom right corner, like in the United States.\n On 1 April 2014, Cartoon Network's DOG moved back to the top-right corner and a new Next banner using graphics from the Check It 3.0. branding package was introduced. Also during the same month,   closed down and was replaced by a reinstated one-hour timeshift service called Cartoon Network +1, which closed down on 5 March 2006. Cartoon Network's Check It 3.0 was fully implemented on Cartoon Network on 21 July 2014 for the official start of the school summer holidays in the UK,   also premiered on the channel on the same day.  In November 2015, Cartoon Network launched their anti-bullying campaign in conjunction with   called Cartoon Network Buddy Network. \n After nearly two years of the Laughternoons programming block was replaced by Mega Mondays on 14 April 2014,  Laughternoons returned to Cartoon Network for a short period in January 2016.  Mega Mondays was the name of Cartoon Network's new episodes programming block for three years before being discontinued in July 2017. It was replaced with New Fridays in March 2018. \n In October 2015, Cartoon Network launched their own localised version of the Cartoon Network Anything app, featuring short-form content such as mini-games and video-clips.  In February 2016, Cartoon Network used graphics from the Check It 4.0 branding package for the first time on a new episode promo for  .  On 22 July 2016, Cartoon Network fully rebranded using graphics from the Check It 4.0 branding package.  In April 2016, Cartoon Network signed a deal with Sky for exclusive on-demand boxset rights for a selection of its animated shows.  In November 2016, Cartoon Network won two   awards for their Where's Ice King and Weetabix Weetabuddies television campaigns.  On 21 July 2017, Cartoon Network fully rebranded using graphics from the Dimensional 1.0 branding package.  In April 2019, Cartoon Network UK's website was hacked, with a Gumball video replaced with an Arabic meme video. \n On 18 November 2020, WarnerMedia was granted a Czech ( ) broadcasting licence for Cartoon Network UK and Ireland, entitled  , with the reason being to ensure continued legal carriage of Cartoon Network UK in the Republic of Ireland and Malta in accordance with the EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) and single market law following the  . Like the UK, the Czech Republic has minimal broadcasting regulations and was chosen for EU licensing purposes as WarnerMedia's   had substantial operations located in the country. Editorially, the channel is still managed from Cartoon Network's offices at WarnerMedia's EMEA headquarters in London. \n When Cartoon Network initially launched, its schedule was mainly made up of short cartoons from both   and other studios, such as  ,   and  . A few years after, it started to broadcast its own programming such as   and   Eventually, most of Cartoon Network's acquired programming was shifted to the sidelines, with the company's original animated series taking up the majority of Cartoon Network's timeslots. \n In September 2000,   began broadcasting weekdays for two hours between 4 pm until 6 pm, and from 9 pm until 11 pm, as well as weekends from 10 am until noon and 10 pm until midnight.   had already been airing on Cartoon Network since March 2000, and had been attracting very good ratings, which may have contributed to the decision to launch Toonami in the UK. Its output consisted almost solely of Japanese anime such as the cult  ,  , and  . The only non-Japanese shows for quite some time were   and  . As time went on, Toonami started to shift away from Japanese anime and action programming, eventually morphing into  . \n Around the same time, there was almost completely new programming on the channel, and so   began in a late night slot; it ultimately branched off into its own channel after the block was discontinued. \n From February 2012 until July 2017, Cartoon Network shifted its major night of premieres to Monday evenings, under the names \"Meaty Mondays\", and as of April 2014 \"Mega Mondays\". Additionally, the block's name would change to \"Mince Pie Mondays\" every December, sporting a more festive look and airing Christmas specials to boot. In May 2014, a much smaller Friday variety block, titled \"Funsize Fridays\" was launched. This block only ran for around 2014, and consisted of playing \"a different show every fifteen minutes\". The shows featured in the block were  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Only one of these shows would air new episodes in this block, passing the baton to a different show monthly. \n Eventually, both of these blocks were discontinued, and Cartoon Network was completely devoid of programming blocks for some time. However, in March 2018, a brand new Friday night premiere block launched, under the simple name \"New Fridays\".  The block aired on Friday nights from 4pm to 9pm, and it was based upon the United States feed's \"NEW NEW NEW NEW\" block, carrying the same neon light branding from its international counterpart. Despite only lasting around four months, the block had a large variety of shows rotating in and out of premiere slots, including  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . The Canadian import   also had its premiere and new episodes restricted to the block. In July 2018, the block was discontinued unexpectedly. \n On 1 March 2022, a Cartoonito block was launched, airing on weekdays from 9 am to 10 am (although it briefly extended to end at 11 am during the Spring-Summer of 2022).  Unlike the channel's other programming blocks, it does not air during the school holidays.\n In May 2000, Boomerang was launched by Cartoon Network in the UK and Ireland,  and most \"classic\" cartoons were moved from Cartoon Network to Boomerang, which initially broadcast from 6 am to 12 am. In October 2001, Boomerang became a 24-hour channel and the remaining \"classic\" cartoons like  , also moved to Boomerang. \n In May 2007, Cartoonito was launched as a pre-school channel replacing  . Cartoonito aired from 4am to 9pm daily. In January 2018, Cartoonito officially began airing 24 hours a day. \n CNX was a channel operated by Turner Broadcasting System Europe in the UK and Ireland between 2002 and 2003. It was aimed at a male audience, with daytime programming aimed at older children and teenagers, and evening programming aimed at older teenagers and young adults. CNX was carried in the 'Entertainment' section of the Sky programme guide, and was also available on cable\n Toonami launched in September 2003 showing action programming. Toonami had originally replaced  , which launched in October 2002. In May 2007, Toonami was replaced by   which was later shut down.\n In April 2006, Cartoon Network Too was launched on   on the same day as sister   and  , broadcasting cartoons primarily made by Hanna-Barbera such as  ,  ,   and  .  Cartoon Network Too aired from 3\u00a0am to 7\u00a0pm every day until May 2007, when it became a 24-hour channel, taking Toonami's slot and getting a new identity.  In April 2014, Cartoon Network Too was replaced by a relaunched version of Cartoon Network +1.\n Cartoon Network +1 originally launched in 1998 as a one-hour timeshift of Cartoon Network before it was replaced by Cartoon Network Too in April 2006. Cartoon Network +1 was relaunched in April 2014 replacing  , just as Cartoon Network Too had replaced them in 2006. In July 2018, Cartoon Network +1 was temporarily replaced by a Ben 10 thematic pop-up channel, the channel reverted to Cartoon Network +1 in July 2018. \n In September 2011,   launched on Sky.  In January 2013, Cartoon Network HD launched on Virgin Media's cable TV platform. \n In April 2007, Cartoon Network launched onto  's On Demand system, thus allowing Virgin Media customers to watch Cartoon Network programmes whenever they like. They can also take advantage of pause, rewind and fast forward functions, when watching these programmes.\n Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe (formerly Cartoon Network Studios Europe, Great Malbrough Productions, Inc. & Cartoon Network Development Studio Europe) is based in Shoreditch, London, located three miles away from Turner EMEA's headquarters.  The studio was named after Great Marlborough Street where Turner Europe, Middle East and Africa's headquarters is located. The studio is the European equivalent to   based in  , USA. The studio was founded in 2007 and in 2011 it produced its first show,  ,  created by  . Cartoon Network Europe has also been involved in other co-productions in the past such as  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,   and  .  The studio has also produced animation for the   organisation.  Originally, the studio's main focus was to produce animated shorts that could potentially become animated shows, this changed when production of   moved from   and Dandelion Studios and went in-house with Studio Soi offering support. In September 2018, Cartoon Network Studios Europe's London-based studio will start production on a new animated show,  . \n On the night of 26\u201327 July 2006, Cartoon Network, along with its sister channels suffered a major technical fault due to a power cut in Soho, London, owing to the  , with thunderstorms taking full force overnight.\n The power cut caused a mix up of Turner Broadcasting System Europe channels (i.e. Cartoon Network being broadcast on Boomerang and Toonami, with Boomerang being broadcast on Cartoon Network Too). Boomerang +1 was off air for some time, while TCM reverted between TCM France and other programming during the times it was able to provide a service.\n TCM 2 remained unaffected due to its downtime of timesharing. Most advertising was suspended and several of the channel websites were offline also. Those who could still receive the channels had a backup transmission played out, making people confused when Cartoon Network Too and Boomerang were showing episodes of The Flintstones at the same time. These backups where played out with a scrolling message which said \"We apologise for the disruption to this programme due to technical problems and we are trying to correct the fault. We will resume normal programming as soon as possible\" in multiple languages.\n Whilst most channels returned to the air within 5\u201310 minutes, it took longer for Cartoon Network Too to resume programming and it was also joked on various animation based forums by Toonami UK viewers, many of whom have made note of their disdain for the direction in which Turner took the brand in the UK, that the backup transmission was more entertaining, purely due to the lack of live action programming aired during the outage.\n The idents on Toonami which aired between shows during the black-out displayed the message \"Sorry! Toonami is broken, we'll be right back as soon as we fix it.\". These idents have since been re-used in disclaimers warning viewers not to try stunts on various shows at home.\n The studio has also produced animated shorts. Animated shorts produced by the studio include The Furry Pals, Mutant Moments, Hamshanks and the Himalolly Railway, Elliot's Zoo, Pinky Malinky and Verne on Vacation. The shorts were showcased in a similar way to   by the American version of Cartoon Network. The videos were available to watch on the Cartoon Network Development Studio Europe YouTube channel which has since closed. \n"},

Styled for  -  in 1957 by   designer  , the Spitfire was introduced at the   in 1962.  It was manufactured at the Standard-Triumph   works, with approximately 315,000 produced over 18 years. \n Developed on a shortened variant of the   saloon's chassis, the Spitfire shared the Herald's running gear and  . The design used   construction, augmented by structural components within the bodywork and rear trailing arms attached to the body rather than the chassis. A manually deployable convertible top, substantially improved on later models, provided weather protection and a bespoke hard-top was available as a factory option.\n The model was named after the famed   fighter plane of World War II. \n The Spitfire evolved over five iterations:\n The Spitfire was conceived of by   to compete in the small sports car market against the  . The Sprite used the drive train of the   in a new lightweight body, while the Spitfire used mechanicals from the Herald saloon. Where the Austin A30 used  , the Herald used a separate   \u2014 which Triumph was able to downsize, saving the cost of developing a completely new chassis-body unit.\n , who had designed the Herald, styled the bodywork, which featured wind-down windows (in contrast to the Sprite and  , which used side curtains) and a cowl composed of the bonnet and wings that opened forward for engine access. The Spitfire's introduction was delayed by its company's financial troubles in the early 1960's and was subsequently announced shortly after Standard Triumph was taken over by  . While taking stock of their new acquisition, Leyland officials found Michelotti's prototype under a dust sheet in a factory corner, and quickly approved it for production. \n The production design changed little from the prototype: the full-width rear bumper was replaced by two part-bumpers curving around each corner, with overriders. Mechanicals derived from the Herald saloon/sedan, with the notable addition of front disc brakes. Bodywork was bolted to the much-modified Herald chassis, the outer rails and the rear outriggers having been removed; with structural outer sills to stiffen the overall design.\n The engine was an 1,147\u00a0cc (70.0\u00a0cu\u00a0in)   with a pushrod     and two valves per cylinder, using twin  . The Herald's   steering and   front suspension carried over, having derived from systems used by the former   company that had been acquired by Standard-Triumph in 1959.\n Rear suspension was by a single transverse-leaf  ,  an arrangement, that unless ameliorated by any of several options, can allow rear tyres to undergo large   changes during fast cornering, leading to  \u00a0\u2013 a   condition in which a vehicle can lose control and spin. As did many manufacturers who used a swing axle arrangement (e.g., Mercedes, Renault, Volkswagen), Triumph would later modify the rear suspension. In 1970, the rear suspension was decambered, by incorporating what Triumph called a \"swing spring\". One leaf was eliminated from the stack and only the bottom leaf was attached rigidly to the differential. The remaining leaves were mounted to pivot freely \u2014 thereby eliminating the worst characteristics of the original   design.\n The Spitfire was an inexpensive small sports car and as such received rather basic trim by today's standards, including rubber mats and a large plastic steering wheel. It was nonetheless considered fairly comfortable at the time, as it had wind-down windows and exterior door locks, as well as relatively full instrumentation.  These early cars were referred to both as \"Triumph Spitfire Mark Is\" and \"Spitfire 4s\",  different from the later Spitfire Mark IV. The \"Spitfire 4\" name indicated the possibility of the appearance of a six-cylinder version. \n In UK specification the inline four produced 63\u00a0bhp (47\u00a0kW) at 5,750\u00a0rpm, and 67\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (91\u00a0N\u22c5m) of torque at 3,500\u00a0rpm. This gave a top speed of 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h), and a 0 to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) acceleration in 16.4 seconds. Average fuel consumption was 31 mpg. \n For 1964 an   became optional to the four-speed  .  Wire wheels and a hard top were also available. \n In March 1965 the Spitfire Mark II launched with a retuned engine, featuring a revised   profile, water-heated intake manifold, and tubular exhaust manifold, increasing power to 67\u00a0bhp (50\u00a0kW) at 6,000 rpm.  The coil-spring design clutch of the Mark I was replaced with a   diaphragm spring clutch; North American models retained the coil-spring housing and were also equipped with   distributors. Exterior trim featured a new grille and badges, and the interior featured revised seats, covering most exposed surfaces with rubber cloth. Carpeting replaced the original moulded rubber floor mats. \n Its base price was \u00a3550; the Austin-Healey Sprite's was \u00a3505 and the MG Midget's \u00a3515.  Top speed was claimed to be 96\u00a0mph (154\u00a0km/h) and its 0\u201360\u00a0mph time of 14.8 seconds was considered \"lively\".  The factory claimed that at highway speeds (70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h)) the car achieved 38.1 miles per imperial gallon (7.41\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 31.7\u00a0mpg ). \n The Mark III, introduced in March 1967, was the first major facelift to the Spitfire. The front bumper was raised in response to new crash regulations, and the front coil springs were slightly raised. Slightly revised bonnet pressings were carried over. Rear overriders were deleted and bumper mounted reversing lights became standard (initially as two separate lights on either side of the number plate, latterly as a single light in a new unit above the number plate). The interior received a wood-veneer instrument surround and a smaller, 15-inch, wire spoked steering wheel. A folding hood replaced the earlier, more complicated design. For most of the Mark III range, the instrument cluster remained centre-mounted (as in the Mark I and Mark II), easily accommodating   and   versions.\n The 1,147\u00a0cc engine was replaced with a bored-out 1,296\u00a0cc unit (the bore increasing from 69.3\u00a0mm (2.73\u00a0in) to 73.7\u00a0mm (2.90\u00a0in), stroke retained at 76\u00a0mm (3.0\u00a0in)), as fitted on the new Triumph Herald 13/60 and   saloons. A new quieter exhaust gave a sweet distinct note and reduced cabin noise. In SU twin-carburettor form, the engine put out a claimed 75\u00a0bhp (56\u00a0kW) at 6,000 rpm, and 75\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (102\u00a0N\u22c5m) of torque at 4,000 rpm, and made the Mark III a comparatively quick car by the standards of the day.  Options included wire wheels, factory hard top and a Laycock de Normanville  . The Mark III was the fastest Spitfire yet, achieving 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 13.4 seconds,  and reaching a top speed of 95\u00a0mph (153\u00a0km/h). Average fuel consumption was 33mpg.  The Mark III continued production into 1971, well after introduction of the Mark IV. \n On 8 February 1968, Standard-Triumph general manager   drove the 100,000th Triumph Spitfire off the Canley production line.  More than 75% of this number had been exported outside the UK, including 45% to the US and 25% to mainland European markets. \n The 1968 model featured dual system (aka tandem) brakes with a brake failure warning device. The engine used a revised camshaft and a distributor with idle speed ignition timing retarded to address emissions. The twin SU carburettors now included overrun valves in the throttle discs and anti-tampering features on carburettor fuel-air mixture nuts. \n Starting in 1969, US-bound models were \"federalised\" to comply with safety and emissions regulations. A reduced compression ratio of 8.5:1 resulted in a slight decrease in power (68\u00a0bhp) and 73\u00a0ft-lbs of torque. However, the 0\u201360 time of 14 seconds was still faster than the Mark II. The instrument panel was moved in front of the driver, and new seats were introduced with integrated headrests to help against whiplash. Cosmetically, the wood dash was replaced with a matte black finished assembly intended to imitate an aircraft cockpit.\n The Mk. III's final production year (1970) included an integrated rear reverse and license plate lamp, side lamps at the front and rear and new badging.  The separate \"Triumph\" letters on the front of the bonnet were removed and \"Triumph\" and \"Spitfire\" rectangular badges were used in the front, rear sides and rear. A limited number of U.S. market 1970s were adorned with an RAF style \"Spitfire\" badge (U.K. models had a plain badge without the RAF roundel) that rested in the right corner (car opposing point of view) of the bonnet. Additional exterior changes introduced included a zip up rear window, black radiator grille and a black (vs body coloured) windscreen surround. Full wheel covers of two styles were used including the 1969 introduced model with \"SPITFIRE\" circumscribing the hub and a unique derivative without the branding. Interior changes included a steering column mounted ignition switch, a key-in-ignition warning buzzer, driver's side under-dash courtesy lamp and a new black spoked steering wheel. Under the bonnet, some markets had the twin SU carburettors replaced with a single Zenith-Stromberg carburettor. \n The Mark IV featured a redesigned rear, similar to the   and   models, both also designed by Michelotti. The front end was revised with a new bonnet pressing, eliminating the weld lines on top of the wings, door handles were recessed, the convertible top received squared-off corners. The interior was revised to include a full-width dashboard, with instruments ahead of the driver rather than over the centre console, initially finished in black plastic and then from 1973 finished in wood.\n The engine was now rated at 63 horsepower for the UK market, with a 9:1 compression ratio and twin SU HS2 carburettors. (The less powerful North American version continued to use a single Zenith Stromberg carburettor and an 8.5:1 compression ratio) due to the German DIN system; the output was the same for the early Mark IV. Performance was slower than the Mark III due to its weight increase and taller 3.89:1 final drive as opposed to the earlier 4.11:1.\n The Mk. IV engine displaced 1,296\u00a0cc (79.1\u00a0cu\u00a0in) throughout the production run, and in 1973 received larger big-end bearings to rationalise production with the   2.5-litre engines. The engine was also detuned to meet new emissions regulations. With the overall weight also increasing to 1,717\u00a0lb (779\u00a0kg) performance dropped, with 0 to 60\u00a0mph (0 to 97\u00a0km/h) now in 15.8 seconds and top speed reduced to 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).  Fuel economy was 32\u00a0mpg  (8.8\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 26.6\u00a0mpg ).  \n A revised hardtop also became available, with rear quarter-lights and a flatter rear screen.\n Importantly, the heavily criticised rear suspension was decambered, incorporating what Triumph called a \"swing spring\". One leaf of the suspension \"stack\" was eliminated and only the bottom leaf was attached rigidly to the differential. The remaining leaves were mounted to pivot freely \u2014 eliminating the worst characteristics of the original  . This was a different approach than that taken with the   and  , both of which received new lower wishbones and Rotoflex half-shaft couplings. The result on all these cars was improved handling.\n The Mark IV went on sale in the UK at the end of 1970 with a base price of \u00a3735. \n In 1973 in the United States and Canada, and 1975 in the rest of the world, the 1500 engine was used on the MK IV body to make the Spitfire 1500. Although in this final incarnation the engine was rather rough and more prone to failure than the earlier units, torque was greatly increased by increasing the cylinder stroke to 87.5\u00a0mm (3.44\u00a0in), which made it much more drivable in traffic. \n While the rest of the world saw 1500s with a   of 8.0:1, the American market model was fitted with a single   and a compression ratio reduced to 7.5:1 to allow it to run on lower octane unleaded fuel.  With the addition of a   and  , the engine only delivered 53\u00a0bhp (40\u00a0kW) (DIN) with a slower 0\u201360\u00a0mph time of 16.3 seconds.  The notable exception to this was the 1976 model year, where the compression ratio was raised to 9.1:1. This improvement was short-lived, however, as the ratio was again reduced to 7.5:1 for the remaining years of production.\n In the UK the 9:1 compression ratio, less restrictive emissions control equipment, and the Type HS2 SU carburettors now being replaced with larger Type HS4 models,  led to the most powerful variant to date. The 1500 Spitfire now produced 71\u00a0hp (DIN) at 5,500 rpm, and produced 82\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (111\u00a0N\u22c5m) of torque at 3,000 rpm.  Top speed was now at the 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) mark, and 0 to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) was reached in 13.2 seconds.  Fuel economy was reduced to 29mpg. \n \nFurther improvements to the suspension followed with the 1500 included longer swing axles and a lowered spring mounting point for more negative camber and a wider rear track. The wider, lower stance gave an impressive skid pad result of 0.87g average. The gearbox gained synchromesh on its bottom gear. The American market Spitfire 1500 is identified by large plastic over-riders and wing mounted reflectors on the front and back wings/fenders. US specification models up to 1978 featured chrome bumpers, and on the 1979 and 1980 models these were replaced by black rubber bumpers with built-in over-riders, using chassis extensions to support the bumpers.\n Detail improvements continued to be made throughout the 1500's production run, including reclining seats with \"chequered brushed nylon centre panels\" and head restraints, introduced for domestic market cars early in 1977 along with a new set of column stalk operated minor controls (as fitted already in the  ) replacing the old dashboard mounted knobs and switches.  Also added for the model's final years were a wood dash, hazard flashers and an electric screen washer, in place of the previous manual pump operated ones.  Options such as the hard top, tonneau cover, map light and overdrive continued to be popular, but wire wheels ceased to be available.\n The 1980 model was the last and the heaviest Spitfire, weighing 1,875\u00a0lb (850.5\u00a0kg).  Base prices for the 1980 model year were $7,365 in the US and \u00a33,631 in the UK. \n Assembled at   in August 1980 shortly before the factory closed, the last Spitfire was an   UK-model including the factory hardtop and overdrive options. Never sold to the public, it remains on display at the  .\n Popular in street and rally racing, Spitfires won numerous   in F and G Production classes; won its class at the 1964 Tour de France rally, coming in second overall, and won the 1964 Geneva Rally. In 1965, a Spitfire won its class in the  . \n \n \n"},

The strip was launched in     on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original   media from the show.  This strip began what has become known as the ' ': running from 1964 to 1979.  The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which   began creating strips for the  . The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to   (then  ) in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips.\n , according to   historian Jeremy Bentham, had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like   had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so   began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on  .    - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for   with the  , and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.  The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to   comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.  This means that the   comic strip in   was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization   not being released until later the same week on 12 November.  One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n There were other differences too. The rights to use   applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every instalment.  Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding   foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the   strip, only the inhabitants of   from \" \" (1965) - the   and   - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the   - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ( ) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with   (aka  ) comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.  \" \" strip appeared in issue 1 of   (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four instalments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n  There were three artists during the   First Doctor period.   was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor).  Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the   strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965   and two single episode strips for the 1965  .   took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for   between October 1965 and April 1966.  He also produced one of the two single episode strips for that year's   released some months after his tenure came to an end due to illness.  These strips were produced much earlier in the year (April) ready for the more complex print procedure, hence the appearance in the table below which makes it look as if Mevin returned to the script some time later. After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the   strip was taken on by   who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966   and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966  .  Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for  , and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began late December 1966. \n  The situation with the scripts is more complex. Writing in 1982, Jeremy Bentham, the first researcher of   comic strips, believed these strips to have been written by the artists who drew them. Thus in 'those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.  However, this view was later revised. John Ainsworth, another comic strip historian, said in an interview: 'There's quite a mystery surrounding around who actually wrote the scripts for the early Hartnell   strips, or indeed, all the Hartnell   strips. It was thought that the artists wrote them, but, after talking to [...] one of the artists, Bill Mevin [...] he doesn't know who wrote them but he knows he did actually work from scripts someone else provided'  In the same documentary, Mevin confirmed this saying,   strips were 'a production line [...] a conveyor belt. I'd get a script and I'd draw it'.  Later research by Paul Scoones in   (2012) clarified some aspects of script production. In an overview, Scoones notes: 'Writers and artists were seldom named on the strips, which presents a challenge when trying to credit stories', and while all the artists have been identified, some of the writers 'unfortunately remain unknown'.  The first writer Scoones identifies is   with the fifth story of the Neville Main tenure, and a couple more Main strips soon thereafter.  This information comes from Motton himself, as indicated in a footnote from Scoones regarding correspondence with the writer between March and May 2012.  Motton would go on to script another couple of stories the following year for the   (released September 1966). As these strips were produced earlier in the year, during the change over between the second and third artists Mevin and Canning, Motton ended up writing for all three of the First Doctor artists.  Scoones goes on to possibly identify a second writer,   from a third writer,  .  During correspondence with Scoones between February and March 2010, Cook writes he took over the strip from 'a freelance scriptwriter called Tom - I can't for the life of me remember his last name'. Scoones goes on to suggest from further information given by Cook that this was 'Tully, a prolific comic strip writer', adding he later confirmed this with Motton.  However, it remains unknown which stories Tully may have written, and indeed if there were other writers involved in the Main and Mevin periods. In an online errata, Scoones subsequently withdrew and corrected this claiming, writing:\n \"It was Thomas Woodman, not Tully, who worked on the strip. Tully was writing for Valiant in 1965 and worked on strips for Battle and 2000AD until the late 1980s. David Motton appears to have got Woodman and Tully mixed up in his recollection. Roger Noel Cook has subsequently confirmed that the \u2018Tom\u2019 whose surname he initially couldn\u2019t recall was Woodman. There is no evidence that Tully worked on the Doctor Who strip.\" \n With respect to Cook, he took over the scripting at the same time that Canning took over the artwork, this 'marking the beginning of a four year collaboration' for   on a number of strips.  And once again, just like Canning, Cook would go on to work on the Second Doctor run, beginning late December 1966. \n  Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.  Of course, given the information above, we now know the stories were not by Main at all.\n The list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in   ( ) as well the yearly   ( ) and   ( ). The order is that designated by the publication date, as integrated by Paul Scoones. \n World Distributors issued   annuals from 1966 (as well as one special). Most of their content was short stories. However, they did also have some comic strips, increasingly so as the years progressed. During the period of the First Doctor, however, there was only one strip, in the annual for 1967.\n \n \n"},

It is built around two   (hence the \"2\" in 2GM20) of 75\u00a0mm in diameter and 72\u00a0mm in  , adding up to 0.635 litres in displacement: each cylinder is roughly the size and volume of a 300\u00a0ml  .

The maximum output at the crankshaft is 13.4\u00a0kW, at 3600\u00a0rpm. \n The engine delivers roughly 16  , for a weight of about 114\u00a0kg.\n The engine is equipped with a starting motor (D.C. 12V, 1\u00a0kW), and an   to provide electricity and charge onboard   (12 , 55 ).\n The engine is typically activated by a key and a starting motor switch. Upon turning the key and pressing the starting motor switch, the oil pressure alarm will ring for about a second until the engine starts to run. The exit of cooling water from the   into the sea (typically at the   of the boat) should be checked at that time. After a few minutes, the hot cooling water alarm will sound if the cooling water does not get through the engine (as when the seawater cock has remained closed -most likely case- or if something is clogging the seawater tubing).\n The 2GM20 series uses either a    , or an   cooling system (specified by the suffix letter F i.e. 2GM20F).   is pumped into the engine through a seawater   (  type). In the engines equipped with a direct seawater cooling system, seawater is used to cool the internals of the engine directly. The engines equipped with a fresh water cooling system have an additional  , where heat transfer occurs between the seawater and internal  .\n The impeller of the seawater pump can suffer from wear and tear, especially when run dry for some period of time, in which case it has to be replaced to avoid loss in the flow of cooling seawater, a potential source of engine overheating.\n A particularly difficult problem in tropical waters is jellyfish.  Their tentacles can be sucked into water intakes.  In extremes, it is possible for the rubber exhaust hose to catch fire, the plastic silencer to melt and the head-gasket to fail.  In colder waters, boats are far less likely to meet such problems.  The solution is to have a large basket-type water strainer and overheat alarms (standard on most Yanmar engines)\n The seawater pump is rotated by a short   linked to the crankshaft.\n An inline   is easily accessible from the front part of the engine. The filter retains solid particles and separates water from diesel (as water is heavier than diesel, it will settle at the bottom of the filter), just before the diesel fuel enters the highly sensitive high-pressure  . The water inside diesel fuel can lead to rusting of the internals of the engine, as well as lubrication problems. The filter element is made of fluted paper with metal end caps.\n When the engine has to be bled because air has penetrated into the pipes (usually after running out of diesel), it will usually be necessary to bleed the diesel filter: the top vent is unscrewed so as to let the excess air escape, while diesel fuel is pumped into the fuel filter with the manual fuel lift pump (just behind the yellow  ). The vent can be screwed shut when diesel fuel starts to gush out of it.\n A primary fuel filter is usually installed upstream of the engine, so as to filter out the larger particles and filter a larger quantity of water that might be present in the fuel.\n Every time a filter is disassembled or changed, it will be necessary to bleed it so as to remove excess air, again by opening the top vent so as to let diesel chase all the air (diesel fills up the filter either through gravity -usually the case for the primary filter- or with the help of the fuel lift pump -usually the case for the engine fuel filter-) and diesel starts to gush out. The vent should then be screwed shut.\n The 2GM20 and 3GM30 (three-cylinder) series have now been superseded in the Yanmar catalog by the new lightweight and modernized engines, the 2YM15, 3YM20, and 3YM30. These new engines also feature simplified maintenance of the seawater pump and other services points, as they are now located on the front part of the engine.  These new engines also meet new   introduced in the EU and the US in 2006. \n"},

It was also the temporary home of the   during a two-month period in 1911 while the   was being rebuilt after a fire.\n The ballpark's formal name, as painted on its exterior walls, was  . Because the park was located on top of a ridge of Manhattan Island, it came to be known as Hilltop Park, and its team was most often called the   (as well as the Americans and the Yankees). This \"Highland\" connection contrasted with their intra-city rivals, the Giants, whose Polo Grounds was just a few blocks away, in the bottomland under  .\n Hilltop Park sat on the block bounded by  , 165th Street,  , and 168th Street. The structure consisted of a covered grandstand stretching from first base to third base and uncovered bleacher sections down the right and left field lines. Originally built in just six weeks, the park sat 16,000, with standing room for an additional 10,000 or so. The bleachers were covered in 1911, and also bleachers to seat an additional 5,000 fans were built in 1911 (partially to accommodate Giants fans, who were temporary tenants after the Polo Grounds fire) in center field.\n The field was initially huge by modern standards \u2014 365\u00a0ft (111\u00a0m) to left field, 542\u00a0ft (165\u00a0m) to center field and 400\u00a0ft (120\u00a0m) to right field. An inner fence was soon constructed to create more realistic action.  Both the park and the nickname \"Highlanders\" were abandoned when the American Leaguers left, at the beginning of the 1913 season, to rent the Polo Grounds from the Giants. The Polo Grounds had a far larger  , and by that time was made of concrete due to the 1911 fire. Hilltop Park was demolished in 1914.\n    came to New York City in 1903 when gambler   and former New York City Police Chief   bought the   franchise for $18,000, equal to $610,400 today. They established the team at Hilltop Park, a hastily constructed wooden park seating about 16,000 fans, on the west side of Broadway between 165th and 168th streets. It was catty-corner to the  , which at that time was located at 99 Fort Washington. The land was acquired via a ten-year lease, arranged by the  . \n The block was effectively parkland, with many trees to be cut down and an artificial lake to be drained and filled in.  In mid-April, the owners announced that the new ballpark was to be officially known as  . \n Between that fact and the club president Joseph Gordon being fancifully linked by sportswriters to the  , the team nickname \"Highlanders\" followed logically. Opening Day came on April 30, 1903, when the   played the  . \n The ballpark site was quite large for its time (9.6 acres (3.9\u00a0ha) or nearly double the size of many ballpark sites of that era), and the south portion of the land plot was used for the parking of first carriages and later automobiles.  The shape of the land plot was a large trapezoid with right angles at the site's northeast and southeast corners.  The left field foul line ran mostly North to South and was parallel to Fort Washington Road (the western boundary of the park). The left field foul line would, if extended about 20 additional feet, have intersected 168th Street at less than 90\u00b0. The right field foul line would, if extended, have intersected Broadway (the eastern boundary of the park) at more than 90\u00b0. The ballpark site was thus   in shape and large for the  .\n The   of 16,000 was also rather large for this time period. Capacity in the dead-ball Era was a flexible concept. In accordance with the practices of the day, overflow crowds were allowed to stand in the perimeter of the outfield. In addition, for \"big\" games, additional standees were allowed down the foul lines and between home plate and the backstop. Thus the effective overall capacity of the park was closer to 25,000, although even when stuffed to the gills, it fell well short of the normal capacity of the Polo Grounds.\n The original 1903 construction of Hilltop Park cost about $200,000, more than two-thirds of which was spent for   and  ; and the   of the Highlanders,  , laid out the  .  The ballpark consisted of a covered grandstand of three sections, although it was not actually roofed until June 1 that season. Two sections of the grandstand were parallel to the foul lines and the third section was a short intermediate diagonal, which formed the backstop. The grandstand extended a short way past both first and third bases, and a clubhouse was located behind the center field fence. Single-deck bleachers that extended down both foul lines reached from the grandstand almost to the fences. The third base bleachers were not finished until June 1903. These first and third base bleachers angled towards the foul lines reducing the foul area at the fences to about 15 feet. A modest-sized scoreboard was in fair territory down the left field foul line. The main entrance to the park was on Broadway and a ramp led up to the top of the first base grandstand. Unlike many of the other contemporary wooden ballparks-this one never burned.\n Hilltop Park was not in good condition when it opened. There was a swamp in right field that had yet to be filled with rock, the outfield had no grass, the grandstand had not been completed, and players had to dress at their hotel rooms because the clubhouse was not completed. When Hilltop Park was finally completed, a single-tier wooden covered grandstand extended from the third base dugout to homeplate, and around to the first base dugout. Uncovered grandstands extended to both foul poles. From behind homeplate, fans could see scenic views of the   and  .\n The ball club continued work on the outfield. Prior to the 1904 season, it was reported, \"the rather deep hollow at right field has been nearly obliterated, which will increase the playing space of that portion of the park many feet.\" \n After the   burnt down in 1911, the Highlanders/Yankees offered to share their facility with the New York Giants, and the grateful National Leaguers took up temporary residence in Hilltop Park. The Highlanders added a bleacher section in deep center field, painted black to serve as a batter's eye screen. After two more seasons, the lease expired and the American Leaguers moved a few blocks east and south into the rebuilt Polo Grounds to sub-lease from the Giants. At that point the nickname Highlanders was dropped as the team was now strictly \"the Yankees\". The last big league game played at Hilltop Park was on October 5, 1912.\n Although the Yankees were done at the Hilltop, other events were staged there in the fall of 1912, including high school football and  .  The park was demolished in 1913.\n The Highlanders / Yankees were not particularly successful during their stay at the Hilltop. There was no hint that the club would eventually become baseball's greatest dynasty. Their best season was 1904, when they were in a tight race with Boston all summer. The season ended on October 10, with the Hilltop hosting a doubleheader against Boston, who led by 1 1/2 games. A sweep by the home team would have won the league championship for New York. However, Boston won the first game by scoring a tie-breaking run in the top of the ninth inning. With a Boston runner on third, New York pitcher   threw a spitball that got away and sailed over the catcher's head. The runner on third easily came across the plate with what proved to be the pennant-clinching run.[ , October 11, 1904, p.\u00a011] The   giddily called the game \"The greatest victory ever won in outdoor sport.\"\n Although the Highlanders failed to win the league title, their unexpected presence in the pennant race ultimately led to the stabilization of the modern  . The Giants were on their way to winning the National League flag, and they announced ahead of time that they had no intention of playing against their cross-town rivals in a post-season World Series. Although Boston prevailed in the American League race, the Giants stuck with their plan, and no Series was played. The resulting public outcry spurred the Giants' owner to organize a committee and establish rules for how future Series were to be conducted.\n Two   pitchers had good outings at Hilltop Park in 1908.\n  outfielder  , \"The Georgia Peach\", made many a mark on the game of baseball, some famous and some infamous. At least one of each happened at the Hilltop:\n The site where Hilltop Park once stood remained vacant until the land was purchased by   for the express purpose of building the world's first academic medical center.  Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center opened in 1928 and is now called   /  .\n Some of the buildings visible in the background of ballpark photos still stand. They include a trio of six-story buildings at the northwest corner of Broadway and 168th (behind center field); and the   (behind left field), which was built in 1911. Those buildings also appear in pictures of the tabernacle built for   on the ballpark site.  \n The site of the hearing-impaired institution to the southwest is now a parking lot for the Medical Center. Most of the other buildings visible in ballpark photos are gone, including the five-story Public School 169, behind right-center field.\n On September 30, 1993 a plaque was placed on the hospital grounds to mark the former location of home plate in Hilltop Park.

Their oil was used as a lubricant and in lighting, as whale oil was; and the leftover bones and carcasses were valuable as fertilizer. He opened the first processing plant. By 1885, Reedville was heavily engaged in the menhaden fishing industry. Menhaden processing factories on Cockrell Creek produced fish oil, meal, and fertilizer from menhaden. The menhaden fishing industry brought tremendous wealth to Reedville and to Northumberland County. Reedville, a town of approximately 500, was once known as the wealthiest town in the United States, due to its large income produced by the menhaden industry. \n Fishing boat captains and factory owners, who made their fortunes from menhaden, built homes along what is now Main Street.\n Dozens of  , most recently Omega Protein Corporation (successor to Zapata Haynie, Reedville Oil and Guano Company, and Haynie Products Company) and Standard Products Company, have dotted the Northumberland coastline near Reedville and other fishing communities.\n Omega Protein remains the largest industrial organization in the area.  The company, with several hundred employees, has a fleet of large oceangoing fish-harvesting vessels supported by a number of spotter aircraft.

WERX began as a   station but changed to   during the summer of 1965, and enjoyed moderate success as a Top 40 rocker until dropping the format in May 1968.  The station's potential was always limited due to its poor signal and the fact that co-channel WCKY would begin to interfere with WERX's signal even before WERX's sign-off (and still does to this day).

Sunday programming included church services in Spanish and English as well as English-language   and   shows.\n In early February 2010, the former owner of   1140 AM \"1140 Jamz,\" Robert S. Womack, moved that station's Urban AC format and air lineup to WYGR, in anticipation of WJNZ's switch to a Catholic religious format in the wake of its sale to Holy Family Radio. WJNZ, like WYGR, is a daytimer. It is unclear at this time if the WJNZ calls will migrate to 1530 AM to match the new format, but given the fact that WYGR now identifies as \"GR1530,\" it seems unlikely.\n WYGR also transmits FM rebroadcaster in the form of translator   at 94.9\u00a0MHz, licensed to Grand Rapids. However, because of Lansing's WMMQ 94.9 there is slight interference, especially on the further east side of the city towards Kentwood.

In February 2012, it was reported that the translator had begun operations at 94.9 FM.\n On December 10, 2018, WYGR changed their format from urban adult contemporary to classic country, branded as \"Jethro FM\". \n The weekday hours previously consisted of the nationally syndicated   Morning Show, followed by the midday drive featuring local Disc Jockey \"DJ Z\".

On Thursdays and Fridays \"The Maddog Show\" featuring \"DJ Maddog\" airs at 6p.m.. The shows format veers from the   normally aired on the station to a   format. Maddog's personality is also a stark contrast of the political seriousness of \"The Pulse of The City.\"\n WYGR's FM translator represented the latest attempt to bring an FM R&B station to West Michigan. In 1993 the first attempt was launched at Muskegon's   \"Magic 108\", also there was a second attempt with   launching as \"Power 95.3\" which have both since become defunct.

The Rhythmic direction has continued under Clear Channel's ownership.  WSNX also features a prepackaged Hip-Hop/R&B format from Clear Channel on its HD-2 side channel.\n \n \n"},

Although several authors claim it is an older belief, no such evidence has been documented so far. In fact, the earliest attestation of 13 being unlucky is first found after the   in Europe.\n  have been attested since at least around 1450 with the  . One of the   in tarot represents Death, and is numbered 13 in several variants.\n In 1781,   writes of this card's presence in the   that the number thirteen was   (\"always looked upon as unlucky\").  In 1784,   cites G\u00e9belin, and reaffirms that the tarot card number 13 is death and misfortune ( ). \n Since at least 1774, a superstition of \"thirteen at a table\" has been documented: if 13 people sit at a table, then one of them must die within a year.  The origin of the superstition is unclear and various theories of its source have been presented over the years.\n In 1774,   speculated: \n \nSince I know from experience that superstition loves nothing better than religious matters as its proofs, I believe I'm almost certainly unmistaken when I derive the origin of the matter of the number XIII from the passage of the Gospel where the Savior sat at table with twelve disciples at the Easter meal.\n From the 1890s, a number of English-language sources reiterated the idea that at the  ,  , the   who betrayed  , was the 13th to sit at the table.  The Bible says nothing about the order in which the Apostles sat, but there were thirteen people at the table.\n In 1968,   in   recounts a   about 12 gods having a dinner party in  . The trickster god  , who was not invited, arrived as the 13th guest, and arranged for   to shoot   with a mistletoe-tipped arrow. This story was also echoed in   by folklore historian Donald Dossey, citing Hill.  However, in the   by  , the story about   and   does not emphasize that there are 12 gods, nor does it talk about a dinner party or the number 13.\n The disaster that occurred on   may have been a factor that led to a renaming that prevented a mission called STS-13.    was the name of the thirteenth Space Shuttle flight.  However, originally   was the mission originally numbered STS-13  STS-41-C was the eleventh orbital flight of the space shuttle program. \n The numbering system of the   was changed to a new one after  .  The new naming scheme started with STS-41B, the previous mission was STS-9, and the thirteenth mission (what would have been STS-13) would be STS-41C.  The new scheme had first number stand for the U.S. fiscal year, the next number was a launch site (1 or 2), and the next was the number of the mission numbered with a letter for that period. \n In the case of the actual 13th flight, the crew was apparently not superstitious and made a humorous mission patch that had a   on it.  Also, that mission re-entered and landed on   which one crew described as being \"pretty cool\".  Because of the way the designations and launch manifest work, the mission numbered STS-13 might not have actually been the 13th to launch as was common throughout the shuttle program; indeed it turned out to be the eleventh.  One of the reasons for this was when a launch had to be scrubbed, which delayed its mission. \n NASA said in a 2016 news article it was due to a much higher frequency of planned launches (pre-Challenger disaster).  As it was, the Shuttle program did have a disaster on its   and thirteenth mission going by date of launch, which was  .  The actual mission   was successful, and had actually launched earlier due to the nature of the launch manifest. \n Many ships, including cruise liners have omitted having a 13th deck due to triskaidekaphobia. Instead, the decks are numbered up to 12 and skip straight to number 14.  Hotels, buildings and elevator manufacturers have also avoided using the number 13 for rooms and floors based on triskaidekaphobia. \n In some regions, 13 is or has been considered a lucky number. For example, prior to the First World War, 13 was considered to be a lucky number in France, even being featured on postcards and charms.  In more modern times, 13 is lucky in   except in some contexts, such as sitting at the dinner table.  In Cantonese-speaking areas, including Hong Kong and Macau, the number 13 is considered lucky because it sounds similar to the Cantonese words meaning \"sure to live\" (as opposed to the unlucky number 14 which in Cantonese sounds like the words meaning \"sure to die\").   was started by 13 men with $13 and 13 prayers, so 13 is considered a lucky number. Friday the 13th is the luckiest day at Colgate. \n A number of sportspeople are known for wearing the number 13 jersey and performing successfully. On November 23, 2003, the   retired the number 13 for  , who played quarterback for the Dolphins from 1983 to 1999.  , St. Louis Rams quarterback (NFL MVP, 1999 & 2001, and   MVP) also wore number 13.  , 13-time NBA All-Star, has had his No. 13 Jersey retired by the NBA's Golden State Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers; Los Angeles Lakers, Harlem Globetrotters, and Kansas University Jayhawks, all of which he played for. In 1966, the   achieved their best-ever result at the World Cup final tournaments by finishing third, thanks to a Mozambican-born striker,  , who has scored nine goals at World Cup \u2013 four of them in a 5-3 quarterfinal win over   \u2013 and won the   as the tournament's top scorer while wearing the number 13. In the   and   World Cup finals, Germany's   and  , respectively, played and scored in the final, wearing the number 13.  More recent footballers playing successfully despite wearing number 13, include  ,  , and  .  Among other sportspeople who have chosen 13 as their number, are    ,  ,   and   due to the number being considered lucky in Venezuelan culture. Swedish-born hockey player  , who played 14 of his 18 NHL seasons for the  , setting team records for goals and points, had his number 13 retired by the team on 15 October 2016.\n Outside of the sporting industry, 13 is used as a lucky number by other individuals, including   who has made prominent use of the number 13 throughout her career. \n"},

The town was built to house the   (UCLouvain) which owns the entire territory of the town;  following the linguistic quarrels that took place in Belgium during the 1960s, and   claims of discrimination at the  , the institution was split into the Dutch language   (KU Leuven), which remained in  , and the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain.\n To a great extent, it still lives following the rhythms of the university that is its  . However, with the construction of   shopping complex, the   exhibition centre and auditorium, a large cinema complex, and five museums, it is beginning to grow beyond its academic roots.\n Louvain-la-Neuve was born as a result of the  , which led to the split of the  . Following the elections prompted by this affair, the expansion of the French-speaking part of the Catholic University of Leuven was voted upon and approved on 18 June 1968. A few weeks later, the separation was made official. It resulted in the creation of the   (KU Leuven), the Dutch-speaking university, that would stay in  , and the   (UCLouvain), which had to move to the future site of Louvain-la-Neuve, except for the French-speaking medical faculty, which moved to   (often called \"Louvain-en-Woluwe\"), in the suburbs of  . The first blueprints of Louvain-la-Neuve were made in a hurry and under dramatic times.\n After much deliberation, the university administration agreed on a building site near the town of  , in the French-speaking part of the   (today's  ). They bought a 9\u00a0km  plot of beetroot farmland, which became the site from which the new town would arise. Construction started on 20 January 1969.\n Put under the direction of  , Jean-Pierre Blondel and  , this urbanistic project saw the first students and inhabitants arrive in 1972. At this time, there were only around 600 permanent residents of the town, who were joined during the day by some students of Applied Sciences, the first faculty to open. With the completion of university buildings and the ongoing residential development, the town experienced rapid growth, with 10,477 inhabitants recorded in 1981. The final goal is to reach 30,000 inhabitants, in addition to the 15,000 students living in town during the academic year.\n The town was created with the sole purpose of hosting the   (UCLouvain). As such all the grounds are property of the university. Consequently, the university was able to play an important role in the conception and planning of the town. They decided that town should not be only inhabited by students, but rather draw a diverse community as is found in any classic town. Moreover, one of the main points of the urban design of Louvain-la-Neuve was to make it people- rather than automobile-centred. As a consequence, the town centre is built on a gigantic concrete slab, with all motorized traffic travelling underground. This allows most of the ground level of the town centre to be car-free. Most buildings are built on the slab ( ), and the pedestrian area is expanding even far from the town centre featuring many mixed use overpasses and traffic calming solutions. This constitutes an early example of the  , with the Agora, Main square and train station in a tight central triangle reachable by foot within 15-20' from the outermost districts.\n The town is clustered around this center in four districts:   and  . A fifth district,  , that was not planned by the university has expanded on the north side of the town. It is distinct from the rest of the town in the willingness of its inhabitants to live outside of the common architectural framework (small cobblestoned and pedestrian streets) used in the other parts of the town.\n Louvain-la-Neuve's location 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) south of   at the crosspoint of several important roads makes it easily reachable by car. Moreover, a train extension has been built from the nearby station of  , which allows passengers to travel to or from Brussels in under an hour.\n Louvain-la-Neuve is now a thriving, growing town. Construction work is constant as many more of the characteristic small two to five floor buildings made of red bricks are erected.\n Due to the large student population that leaves the town during weekends and holidays, Louvain-la-Neuve can be quite empty during those periods. Nevertheless, the student life both day and night is well developed, centered around Student Unions, \"project flats\" (\"kot-\u00e0-projet\"), regional pubs, etc.\n Celebrating its 40th edition in 2017, the   (24-hour bike ride) is the biggest student party in Belgium. The event, which regularly draws upwards of 40 000 students to the city, is organized by a student group called the CSE Animations (Centre Sportif Etudiant) and runs annually from 1:00pm Wednesday to 1:00pm Thursday usually during the fourth week of October.  Due to the recent terrorist attacks in Europe and the existing risk of new ones, the 2016 edition was cancelled. \n The starting concept was simple, to race for 24 hours on a bike. Nowadays, competitors are separated in three categories: Racers, that race seriously; folk bikes, including decorated bikes and home built contraptions; and charity racers raising money for humanitarian causes.\n The festival is an occasion for the numerous student associations in the town to compete in building silly bikes, set up some related activity, or simply provide beer and music to the tens of thousands of students coming from all over Belgium.\n In the morning, the activities end with a concert by some famous singer in the main square.\n This event gives a hint at how student life and traditions have developed on the newly born campus, reviving some long lost customs as the traditional Catholic Belgian students hat, the  .\n The 24 hours have also been at the center of some more political issues. In 1999 it was cancelled due to the death of a drunken student who had fallen from the   in 1998. This happened again at the 2006 edition when a student was found dead in the early morning in the streets of \"the dalle\". The event was also threatened in 2005 and 2006 because of a student associations strike and other organisation problems.\n Created in 1971, Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park is the first of its kind in Belgium and is the biggest one in   (the French-speaking part of  ). It covers 2.31 square kilometres spread over the area of the town of Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve and the municipality of Mont-Saint-Guibert (30\u00a0km away from  ).\n From the outset, the objectives pursued by the development of Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park were to develop cooperation between industry and the   and to contribute to regional economic development. Particular emphasis is placed on environmental-friendliness, as well as the quality of the premises and their surroundings.\n The main area of activity are:\n Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park is now home to more than 130 innovative companies and their 4500 employees, 1   and 3 business centres.\n The   is dedicated to the life and work of the Belgian   Georges Remi (1907\u20131983), who wrote under the pen name  , creator of the series of comic albums,  . It is located in the centre of Louvain-la-Neuve, on the edge of a green park, Le Parc de la Source. This location for the museum was originally chosen in 2001. The futuristic building was designed by the  -winning French architect  . On 22 May 2007 (the centenary of Herg\u00e9's birth), the first stone of the museum was laid. Two years later, in June 2009, the museum opened its doors to the public.\n The Herg\u00e9 Museum contains eight permanent galleries displaying original artwork by Herg\u00e9, and telling the story of his life and career. Although his most famous creation,  , features prominently, his other comic strip characters (such as  , and  ) are also present. The exhibitions also include examples of Herg\u00e9's diverse and prolific output working as a graphic designer in the 1930s. The museum houses a temporary exhibition gallery, which is updated every few months to host new exhibitions (with diverse titles such as   and  ).\n"},

It is known as the Chester southerly bypass between J39 Christleton and J36a Broughton. The A55 crosses the   and the   into Wales, passing close to  , and passing north of  ,   and  . There is a major climb between Broughton and Dobshill (Junctions 36a Broughton to 35 Dobshill) though with no crawler lane. Junction 34/33b is point at which the   converges and then diverges with the A55. The road briefly has a three-lane section as westbound traffic from   can leave towards  . In the eastbound direction another short three-lane section allows vehicles to join the A494 or exit onto the A55 to Chester. Traffic taking the A55 into England must negotiate a tight 270 degree speed-limited single lane curve to climb up and over the A55/A494 at Ewloe loops. Plans to upgrade the A494 between this junction at   and Queensferry were rejected by the   on 26 March 2008 due to their scale. \n From Ewloe, the road is relatively flat until after Northop when it climbs up onto the flanks of Halkyn Mountain range, passing to the southwest of   with major climbs between   and Halkyn (Junctions 33 and 32b) and Halkyn and   Summit (Junctions 32 and 31). This section of road is notorious for poor weather conditions including fog, ice and snow in winter months. In fine weather, however there are extensive views over the   estuary to the  ,   and beyond. The highest part of the road is in the vicinity of Brynford at around 790 feet (240 m). The steep descent towards   is down the new Rhuallt Hill (Junctions 29 to 28), which also provides the first views of the mountains of   in the far distance. There is a crawler lane on Rhuallt Hill for eastbound traffic. The road bypasses St Asaph to the north, and runs past   and   to reach the   coast at   (Junction 23A). From here onwards to  , the route is close to the  .\n Two sections between (Junction 23)   to (Junction 17)   are signed as a 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) speed limit because they are actually  . This is because these sections were built under legislation for building motorways but they were never declared as motorways.  Legally it means these two stretches of the A55 are neither part of the national UK motorway network nor  . As such, the national speed limit does not apply so 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) signs (the maximum speed permitted on UK roads) are used instead.  Unlike other sections of the A55 that have   signage and are accessible to all motor vehicles, motorway restrictions are enforced on these two stretches of road (therefore no pedestrians, learner drivers,  )\n A 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) limit remains in force through the   bypass (  to  ). The restriction was imposed for several reasons. First as a safety precaution because the slip-roads on this stretch are unusually short due to the road's design. Part of it was built on a narrow swathe of land through the town that was once the  ;   had to be rebuilt and the track bed realigned to complete the underpass as the road used the former railway Goods Yard which was relocated to Llandudno Junction. The former four-track railway was reduced to two more northerly tracks to make space for the road. Secondly, the reduced speed limit was intended to reduce road noise for residents. However, since the completion of the Colwyn Bay bypass, the lower speed limit has been an unpopular decision with drivers. \n The crossing of the estuary of the   is by means of an    , the first of its kind constructed in the United Kingdom.  At 1060m, the tunnel is the longest road tunnel in Wales. \n The decision to construct an immersed tube tunnel bypass followed an extensive public consultation, named the Collcon Feasibility Study. This ruled out another bridge by the castle on aesthetic grounds, since it would have damaged the view of the world heritage site  , and the two bridges by   and  . Another alternative bridge crossing was proposed at  , but this too was ruled out for aesthetic reasons. An inland alternative with heavy grades which would have passed over   pass at 430 metres (1,410\u00a0ft), following the old Roman road, was also worked up but rejected for cost and utility reasons as it would have required a very long crawler lane.\n The tunnel was constructed by a  /  joint venture,  as pre-formed   sections, and then floated into position over a pre-prepared trench in the bed of the estuary. The 3 million tonnes of silt and mud extracted to create the trench in which the tunnel sections sat, were vacuumed to one side of the construction site, as to let them drift down river would have harmed the large   fishing beds downstream. The silt was deposited upstream of the bridge at Conwy which created a large new area of low-lying land which was subsequently given to the  . The casting basin for the tunnel sections was later converted into a new marina in the lower estuary. Because of the valuable fishery in the river and also because of the history of     in the catchment of the river, extensive   assessments were made both prior to the construction of the tunnel and subsequently. These studies finally concluded that no significant environmental damage had been caused.\n After five years of construction, the tunnel was opened in October 1991 by  , the tunnel initially had an advisory 50 miles per hour (80\u00a0km/h) speed limit, but this was dropped in 2007 as accidents were rare in the tunnels.\n Leaving Conwy in a westerly direction, the construction of this section has involved major civil engineering works because it crosses two major  : Penmaenbach Point and Penmaenan Point. Work has involved the cutting of several hard rock tunnels beneath the sea cliffs.\n The first to be built in 1932 was the Penmaenbach Tunnel which carried motor traffic to  . Two smaller tunnels through Penmaenan Point, opened 1935, carried the road on to  . This new route, carrying traffic in both directions, relieved the original coach road built by Telford in the early 19th century. Cut into the cliffs by hand, this narrow, winding route hugged the contours around both steep headlands. Telford's route has now been converted into a   across Penmaenbach and Penmaenan Points. Originally at the western end (Llanfairfechan) of the modern Pen-y-Clip tunnel, access was only allowed in an easterly direction because travelling the other way would mean heading the wrong way up the eastbound carriageway. However, in 2011 a purpose-built bridge \u2013 over the westbound carriageway \u2013 was constructed to allow unrestricted access to cyclists and walkers.\n The 1930s alignment was used until a new two-lane Penmaenbach Tunnel opened in 1989 to carry westbound traffic. Eastbound traffic would now travel through the 1932 Penmaenbach Tunnel using both its original lanes. Four years later, work to build the Pen-y-clip tunnel was completed. Like at Penmaenbach it carried westbound traffic while the original road carried vehicles in the opposite direction. Both new routes were subject to an advisory 50\u00a0mph speed limit until these were lifted in 2007 as there had been few accidents.\n However traffic travelling eastbound on the 1930s cliff-hugging route still faced speed restrictions at both tunnel locations. For instance the eastbound carriageway at Penmaenbach is subject to a 30\u00a0mph (50\u00a0km/h) speed limit due to sharp curves and double white lines nominally preclude lane changing. Plans to rectify the awkward alignment by building another tunnel parallel to the current westbound tunnel (as originally intended when the westbound tunnel was proposed) have been discussed for several years. The work in late-2007 at Penmaenbach eastbound has seen the erection of gantries to close lanes when bidirectional working is in place. New bridges over the railway tunnel entrances at each end were added and a footbridge over the railway at the eastern end to accommodate the cycleway.\n Some sections of the rest of the route are of lower standard than that of those further east. Some traffic leaves for major holiday destinations such as   or the  , though much continues on to the port of Holyhead. As such part of the route is not classed as clearway and has two at grade junctions (roundabouts), Penmaenmawr (Junction 16) and Llanfairfechan (Junction 15). The   bypass, in which the road previously terminated and became the   regains high standards and is such through the   section, bar the  , which is a single carriageway deck above the   over the  . In 2007 the Welsh Assembly Government undertook a consultation to determine which of four options would be preferred for  . This section intersects with the   towards  , and the west coast of  .\n The final section of the A55 to be constructed was the   section. This 20 mile (32\u00a0km) section from the end of the Llanfairpwll bypass to     was constructed as   scheme where the builders, a   /   joint venture, earn a   based on usage and lane availability. They also have to maintain the road for the extended period of their shadow toll agreement. When travelling eastbound along this section there are fine views of Snowdonia. The approach to Holyhead required major work with a new section over the sea paralleling the   that carries the original A5 and the  .\n Work started in early 2017 on the upgrading of the 1960s built substandard section of dual carriageway west of Abergwyngregyn from Tai'r Meibion towards Tan-y-lon, which is a relatively narrow section of dual carriageway and prone to flooding. \nAfter a pause, work restarted on the scheme (now known as the Abergwyngregyn-Tai'r Meibion scheme) in 2021 and encompassing some 2.2\u00a0km of the A55. It involves constructing a new road to the north of the dual carriageway for general use including cycleway and farm access. This allowed the closure of 8 central reservation gaps used by slow moving agricultural vehicles which caused safety concerns with the volume and speed of traffic on the dual carriageway. The work was well underway in September 2021 and due to open fully in 2022. \n Plans are also in their final stages to grade separate the two roundabouts at Penmaenmawr and Llanfairfechan planned to be completed by 2022.  A Public Inquiry was due to be held on 21/9/21 in Llandudno Junction concerning issues over the side roads.\nThe two roundabout improvements will now be treated separately and the full plans can be seen on the A55 microsite \nIn June 2021 the Welsh Government decided to review all road schemes whilst looking at public transport alternatives. \nIn September 2021 the Welsh Government announced an expansion of their plans for the North Wales Metro that may impact this road scheme. In particular longer term plans to reopen old rail routes from Bangor to Amlwch and Bangor to West Wales (presumably a link to Cambrian Coast railway and possibly onwards from Aberystwyth to Carmarthen) may impact cash available for road schemes. \nThe Junction 16 scheme involves creating a new grade separated junction close to the Penmaenbach Tunnel with a single overbridge allowing access for all directions. This will replace the limited access junction 16A there for Dwygyfylchi. The existing junction 16 roundabout would be replaced by a limited access junction (westbound off/westbound on) as it is a difficult location close to the North Wales coast railway and cycle route and partly on a railway bridge. A new local road would run from the new Dwygyfylchi interchange to the existing roundabout passing around the rear of the Penguin Cafe/truckstop.\nThe Llanfairfechan junction 15 grade separation is much easier to achieve and will be completed on site as a grade separated junction with a single overbridge allowing access/exit for all possible directions.\n In November 2012, the Welsh Government published two more detailed studies looking at options to improve transport in the North East Wales and the A55 / A494 areas.  Possible changes to be considered further include\n The A55 partly follows the alignment of the   from Chester (Deva) to Caernarfon ( ), particularly from Junction 31 to 30 and Junction 13 to 12. Between Chester and Holywell the alignment of this road is uncertain and between St. Asaph and Abergwyngregyn, the Roman road followed an inland route, via Canovium Roman Fort at Caerhun, avoiding the difficulties of the crossing of the Conwy estuary and the cliffs at Penmaenbach and Pen-y-Clip.\n There are three large service areas on the A55, along with numerous other petrol stations at the side of the road.

He recovered from a slow start to the lead inside the final furlong but was caught in the last stride and beaten a head by Barathea Guest. Despite his defeat he started 11/2 second favourite for the 2000 Guineas on 6 May but finished eighth of the twenty-seven runners behind King's Best.\n After a break of four months, Distant Music returned in the Group Three Park Stakes at Doncaster on 7 September. He started the 4/1 third favourite behind the four-year-old Swallow Flight, a Listed race winner who had finished third in the  . The other three runners were Barathea Guest, Valentino (runner-up in the  ) and Cape Town (third in the  ). He was held up by Hills in the early stages before beginning to make progress in the last quarter mile. He took the lead 150 yards from the finish and won by a neck from Valentino.  Khalid Abdullah's racing manager Teddy Beckett commented \"There has been nothing physically wrong with Distant Music, but he just wasn't right and it was a question of giving him as much time as he needed to come back to form. Barry Hills has done a marvellous job with him\".  On 14 October Distant Music was stepped up in class and distance and started a 20/1 outsider for the   over ten furlongs at Newmarket.

Now owned by Unisys Corporation. Mapper originated in the 1970s  based on some work in the 1960s,  It has been functionally enhanced and kept current. It was also given an extension named ICE - Internet Commerce Enabler. \n Originally available on Sperry's  , implementations now also exist for  ,   and  .  The   on Windows is the most advanced of these. \n MAPPER (MAintain, Prepare, and Produce Executive Reports) (alternatively nicknamed \"Most Amazing Programming Product Ever Released\" by enthusiasts)\u2014officially renamed BIS (Business Information Server) but still called MAPPER by many users \u2014began as an internal product. It was developed in Sperry Univac's computer factory in   to help the company manage their factory producing computer hardware.  It was initially called CRT RPS (Report Processing System), to differentiate it from  . Its first external customer was   Railway. Besides the Santa Fe, the Kansas City government was an early customer. MAPPER became a  popular solution in the Government sector. User group communities formed like the New England MAPPER Users Group. The concept of MAPPER was conceived by Louis Schlueter in 1967 and presented in a whitepaper in February 1968 entitled 418 Report Processing System to management and accepted for development immediately. Three developers (Bill Grey, Louis Schlueter and Chuck Hanson) began coding under another budget that was initially approved for a different project. They had a lot of resistance, such as the lead programmer (Jack Olgren) under the initial testing department (the original programming was for stress testing the hardware), stating  \"You can't use computers that way!\"  but after seeing more of what was happening, he joined the team and eventually became the lead programmer due to his genius mind. Unfortunately, he died a year later, never to see the full realization implemented. There was so much continued obstruction, fighting the   around traditional thinking at that time.\n CRT RPS was renamed MAPPER in 1975. Because of its unofficial status, it was a low-budget development, and was built for minimum use of resources. Today the entire system, minus user data, is only 25 megabytes. It was written in  .  Initially it had only limited string manipulation;  that has since been corrected. A   capability was also subsequently added. The development of the   1100, as well as pressure from customers, led to a release for more general use in 1979.\n In the mid-1980s, Sperry actively marketed MAPPER, including advertising featuring \"MAPPER Man\", the self-empowered executive end-user.  In the Scandinavian countries, Sperry had a MAPPER song\u2014\"Do it the MAPPER way!\" (1983)\u2014written and performed by an  -style group.\n Under Sperry Corp, a MAPPER System Controlled eight Factories, proving  Major Application Design by USERS. The MAPPER system supported over 1,300 applications, 99 percent of which were designed by non DP (Data Processing Department e.g. the old programming methods) users. It had about 20 million lines in the online database. There were 3,700+ registered users on this system, 540 of which were registered as RUN (Application) Designers. A typical day would see over 500,000 manual function starts with an additional 405,000+ function starts under control of 90,000+ RUN application executions. Over 355 million lines of Report data were processed in such a day of service.\n Average MAPPER system response times for the manual functions and RUN executions was ~ 0.4 seconds. Over 7,000 terminals were registered for use on this system. Any prime time, instantaneous sample will show over 1,000 users signed on using the system. This is a mixed computing environment system. Besides the MAPPER service, background batch COBOL applications and transaction processing were also done on the mainframe system.\n The 1st Customer was Santa Fe Railroad. MAPPER Systems were translated in 15 languages, including Chinese and Japanese (which was expanded to 23 in total) and installed worldwide in a customer base worth over $3 Billion. Sperry MAPPER System profits caused the $7 Billion Unisys Merger with Burroughs. This forceful takeover has been seen as the downfall of MAPPER. It was essentially shelved at that time, as no further promotion was done whatsoever. And the name was changed to BIS (Business Information Server).  (Various inside sources said this was because a deal was made to suppress it due to the heavy use by the military and intelligence agencies. As an example, Japan had a boom in all its industry manufacturing because of 500 Mainframes with MAPPER on it.)\n A 1989 survey by   showed that 140 of 224 UNIVAC 1100 customers were using MAPPER. By 2006, there were more than 600 sites using MAPPER for Windows NT.\n Its story is a strong testimony and example to the efficiency and potential of well promoted and coordinated, user-designed computing, Real-Time Report Processing System services.\n Interesting to note that MAPPER was essentially the first blockchain due to the LOG Ledger and function, which is a record of all transactions; who did what, when and where. This LOG maintained a chain of events that was incorruptible or accessible by users who didn't have access rights by the Coordinator. It was also the first spreadsheet, as it was over a decade before LOTUS123.\n An early description of MAPPER was the paper \"MAPPER Was the First User-command Language\" presented at the USE technical conference in March 1983 by Michael Nicoll-Griffith of Canadian Pacific Consulting Services and published as part of the USE proceedings. In 1988, the book \"User-driven Computing\" by Louis Schlueter was published.\n MAPPER use requires that the community have a MAPPER Coordinator, who has a set of privileged tools to monitor and tune the development and control abuses.  MAPPER has over 150 functions that can be used manually, nearly each has a corresponding script command.\n MAPPER was so easy to learn and use that many users became \"RUN\" developers who created applications that ran all their data processing requirements.\n The basic unit of data is called a \"report\".  This appears similar to a   spreadsheet.  It is usual to have sets of similar reports with the same column structure that apply to different categories or groupings of items. Reports are organized into \"drawers\" of identically structured reports, and groups of up to 8 drawers form a \"cabinet\" (4000 total per MAPPER system).  Reports can be between 40 and up to 998 characters wide, depending on platform. On the \"Core MAPPER\" platforms (Windows/Unix/Linux), the drawer size must be a multiple of 2: on the   it can be an odd number.\n Reports are numbered from 1 to the maximum set for the drawer- there is also a report zero, which has a special significance as it acts as both a template and as a filter for the rest of the reports in the drawer.  Drawers have a drawer letter, from   to  .  Cabinets are numbered from 0 and increment by 2 - odd numbered cabinets reference the same data as the matching even cabinet, but provide a read-only view of the data (e.g. cabinet 0 and cabinet 1 represent full and limited access to the same data).  There is a system maximum for a given system, which varies depending on platform and is represented by the system reserved work  .  Drawers run from   to   because   is a special drawer; it is deemed to exist simultaneously in all cabinets, so acts as a global resource.  Drawer   is typically used for \"quick and dirty\" temporary datasets, captured data, prototype run code, notes, documentation and so on. The third report in drawer   in cabinet 36 would be referenced as  , or simply   if the user is logged into cabinet 36 already.\n A major difference from spreadsheets is that MAPPER reports have no built-in calculation capability.  Processing is achieved by applying a \"Command\" or \"Function\" to a report, an action that produces a duplicated \"result\".  This result can be processed further, refining the data down to the most meaning information; a result, which a manipulated copy of the original report. Hence report processing system as part of the original system capability. Thus allowing users to access and manipulate their data needs according to their specifications.\n Another important difference is that MAPPER data is a form of visible-record data; what you see is literally what you get.  Within an individual drawer, reports all have the same line length, which is padded with spaces or tab characters to move you through the data for record input or modification.  By the same token, column sizes within a data record are fixed, however you can create any field size you want up to 999 characters.  You can locate data in either field columns or free form type data that is akin to typed text or paragraph style data.  There are several functions that make locating data quick and efficient. Many functions and methods can be deployed to structure data for even faster responses. The response time on manipulating data was nearly always less than a second.   \n In older versions of MAPPER, security was applied at a cabinet level \u2013 with current versions, security has a finer granularity and is applied at drawer level.  If a user is not granted access to a particular drawer, the data will not be visible to that user.  It's possible to grant either update or read-only access to a given drawer.\n It was the first at many things, including being an  -compliant system.\n When a command is to be performed, the software obtains the data organization from column headings that are above the data.  In essence, it generates the \"schema\" on demand.  Popular commands are \"Search\" to make a subset, \"Sort\" to change the sequence of lines, \"Totalize\" to generate subtotals by type, category or date.  Two independent reports can be combined with \"Match\", while very sophisticated commands like \"Calculate and Update\" include successive steps in one operation. The result of a command can be operated on by a succeeding command. In this way, large processing requirements could be accomplished with just a few commands.  The script code as a single command would execute a manual function and in this way minimize the amount of code required to accomplish tasks. i.e. writing a search program of many lines of code, was already done. And in this way MAPPER was essentially calling macros; the first of its kind also.\n In the operation of MAPPER, the data is not obtained by a program that \"reads\" them, but waits for user action, aside from background jobs. The programmed commands are brought to operate upon it. However, the complete set of available commands remains in the active memory of the computer as interpreted resident commands. Being written in \" \", any command can be used by many thousands of different users concurrently.\n To avoid a bottleneck in disk accesses, the data is spread across multiple shallow reports, so that many users can be in the data and not locked out of a single report.

The brunt of the fighting happened near the village of   and   villages that guard the roads to the   water supply which supplies water to the capital city of  . \n The first clash took place on 20 June 2001, when four policemen from the Radu\u0161a police station discovered an NLA camp of forty insurgents on the steps of \u017deden mountain, during a patrol of the terrain on the border. The police patrol opened fire killing one insurgent and wounding another.  The patrol called on air support which came immediately and pushed the insurgents towards Kosovo. \n On 23 June, one of the most dramatic single events in the conflict occurred when another police border patrol was attacked in an NLA ambush near Radu\u0161a.  The police patrol was led by Aco Stojanovski, the Deputy-Commander of the Radu\u0161a police station.  The insurgents fired at the police vehicle with RPG rockets, throwing three policemen out of the car and leaving one inside.  The NLA attempted to approach the badly wounded policemen. Commander Stojanovski's firing six rounds from an AK-47 at the insurgents saved them until soldiers from the Radu\u0161a border post arrived and repelled the NLA with fire from an armored personnel carrier.  After the conflict, commander Stojanovski became the president of the Union of Army and Police veterans of the Conflict in Macedonia. \n After this ambush there were calls to seriously strengthen the defenses around Radu\u0161a in order to prevent the NLA from capturing the water supply near the village of Rasce which would have stopped the water supply to the capital city of Skopje. \n In the early hours of 10 August 2001, the NLA launched an offensive from the area of Krivenik in the Kosovo Municipality of   ( ), invading the territory of   in the region of Radu\u0161a. The offensive took place during the ceasefire period, only days before the signing of the Ohrid Framework Agreement. The first actions began at 20:00 the same day with a mortar attack on the Radu\u0161a police station, located at the entrance of the village. The police station was manned by only thirty-five policemen. The security forces returned fire and the shootout lasted until 2:00 A.M. Afterwards, the NLA initiated an infantry attack which was repelled by the police.  During the attack one police officer was injured. \n According to information obtained by the Macedonian intelligence service, the attack was conducted by more than six hundred  NLA insurgents, supported by volunteers from the Kosovo Protection Crops.  The Corps came from the town of Krivenik in Kosovo and crossed the Macedonian border into Radu\u0161a during the night. According to the same information, the NLA and KPC plan of action was to neutralise the security forces in the Radu\u0161a sector, then penetrate southwards and capture the Ra\u0161\u010de water spring  which feeds the Macedonian capital Skopje with drinking water. Cutting water supplies would create a humanitarian crisis in the city. \n The Ministry of Interior single-handedly declared an alert condition and sent detachments of the \"Tiger\" special police unit to dig in and secure the Ra\u0161\u010de spring. Other detachments of the \"Tiger\" were sent to rescue thirty-five policemen surrounded at the Radu\u0161a station. Because of the lack of artillery support, and the overwhelming numbers of the NLA encirclement, they dug\u2013in at positions outside Radu\u0161a.  The Minister of Interior Ljube Bo\u0161koski and Prime Minister Ljub\u010do Georgievski asked President Trajkovski for an immediate activation of the army in order to neutralise the invasion from Kosovo. The president, however, encouraged by the NATO and EU envoys, was concentrated on reaching a political solution that respected the conditions of the 5 July Ceasefire Agreement. He asked that the police not respond to provocations in order to avoid an escalation of the conflict. Meanwhile, the encircled policemen in the Radu\u0161a station were left on their own. \n On 11 August, the second day of the battle, the NLA began the most serious attack against the security forces in the Skopje region. A column of two hundred Albanian insurgents attacked the Radu\u0161a army border post with mortar, automatic rifle and sniper fire. The Radu\u0161a army border post, located between the villages of Ku\u010dkovo and Radu\u0161a, was manned by twenty-five soldiers with mortars, automatic rifles, one tank, and three armoured personnel carriers. At the same time, the NLA conducted another assault attack on the encircled police station at the Radu\u0161a village.  The army and police returned fire and, during the heavy fighting, the NLA managed to set fire to the petrol barrels within the barracks of the army border post. The insurgents managed to come so close that they started cutting the wire-fence.  The policemen also managed to repel all of the attacks made on 11 August. \n After the signing of the ceasefire Radu\u0161a was chosen as one of the designated collection sites for the voluntary disposal of NLA weapons where the 115th Brigade which took part in the battle disposed of its weapons and captured vehicles after the Macedonian security forces previously withdrew from the collection sites as was agreed with NATO, the NLA did not honor its commitment to withdraw to lines held before the 5 July ceasefire. \n"},

The male's face is yellow and thickly yellow pollinose, with the middle line broadly shining reddish yellow to ferruginous but never black. The pile is pale yellowish. In profile, the face is concave on the upper three-fifths, convex below this, and the lower two-thirds convex receding, without distinct tubercle although the formation approaches one. The frons is narrowed above, and the upper portion is nearly twice as long as wide, except on the upper fifth yellow pollinose, the pollen paler on the sides before the depression and often somewhat reddish, the polished triangle chiefly blackish. The occiput is yellow to greyish pollinose and has yellow pile. The front is black pilose above suture, yellow below it and sometimes has several hairs immediately above the antennae. The antennae are reddish, sometimes more or less ferruginous, and the third joint (basobasoflagellomere) is brownish above and alically; arista is reddish. In contrast, the female's front is all black pilose, narrowed above, yellowish pollinose, and the middle line is darker and with thin brownish red or yellow pollen.\n The mesonotum is opaque or sub-opaque black in old specimens. The side margins and broadly separated sub-dorsal stripes are opaque yellow or pale greyish, and more or less narrowed towards the posterior margin, but sometimes the middle ones are a little broadened here. The pale vittae are not joined in front. The pleura are yellowish grey pollinose. The scutellum is translucent yellowish, with the very narrow base and corners black or brown. The pile of the thorax is all yellow and short, and on the disc of the scutellum, it is black.\n The abdomen is opaque black, with large yellow spots on the second and third segments, the fourth segment faciate with pollen. \nThe first segment is greyish pollinose except behind the corner of the scutellum, the sides broadly yellow. \n In the second segment, the black forms a rather broad basal facia which is almost as long as the width of the thorax, broadly connected on the middle line with the moderately broader posterior margin. The apex is shining, and the immediate apex is narrowly reddish on the middle part. The posterior facia is of almost equal width but is slightly widened at the middle and sides but reaches or is very narrowly separated from the lateral margin. \n On the third segment, the basal two-thirds are yellow with an oval black spot in the middle at the base, connected in almost its full width the black posterior border. However, in well-preserved specimens, it is more or less broadly pollinose on the connection so that the anterior spot appears isolated. The posterior margin is moderately broadly shining, and the apex is reddish, or sometimes the shining portion is all reddish. The yellow is biconvex behind so the black reaches forwards at the sides and usually touches the lateral margin. \n The fourth segment has a pollinose yellow fascia which is narrower, but slightly narrowed in the middle, its outward posterior portion convex so that each side appears slightly lunulate. The pile is yellow and short, with shorter and stouter piles on each segment behind the fasciae (bands) and reaching the sides on all but the last. \n In the female, the abdominal bands are narrower and the abdominal segments are shorter. The black basal fascia on the second segment extends slightly more towards the sides and is quite as wide as the thorax. The yellow spots are sharper inwardly, seldom obtuse rounded as in the male. The fascia on the third segment occupies but little over half the width of the segment. \n The pollinose fascia on the fourth segment is slightly narrowed in the middle, and its outward posterior portion is convex, so that each side appears slightly lunulate. The fascia on the fifth segment reaches the base on its middle portion or is narrowly separated laterally, increasingly so towards the margin. It is slightly widened laterally, and the segmental margin is yellow as in the preceding segments. In this sex, the pollen is always yellow.\n The cinereous, ashy grey coloration is interspersed with hyaline areas that are often quite yellowish anteriorly and basad of the tip of the first vein. The stigma is luteous, meaning it has a light to medium greenish tinge.

He broke slowly and raced at the back of the pack, then made a 4-wide move around the turn to finish second.  On September 20 at Belmont Park, he was closer to the pace but again finished second after shying at the whip in the stretch.  In his third start on October 20 at Aqueduct, he pressed the pace, then drew away in the stretch to win easily.  He finished his two-year-old campaign on November 29 in the   at Aqueduct. He pressed the pace while racing wide, then dueled the leader down the stretch to come up just short. \n Frosted started his three-year-old campaign on January 24 in the   at  . He was bumped at the start, then stalked the pace from the inside. He made a run coming into the stretch but could not make up ground on the winner, Upstart, being \"clearly second best\" according to the chart.  For his next start in the  , Frosted pressed the pace and took a clear lead rounding the turn. But in the stretch, he slowed down, drifted wide and bumped Upstart who in turn bumped Itsaknockout. Frosted faded to fourth and Upstart was disqualified. \n It was later discovered that Frosted had suffered from a trapped   during the race, obstructing his breathing. Trainer Kiaran McLaughlin had a minor surgical procedure performed on Frosted's throat, added blinkers and changed jockeys to Joel Rosario.  Frosted was entered in the   on April 4 at Aqueduct, the same track at which he had broken his maiden back in October. Frosted responded with a convincing victory despite racing wide around the final turn. \"We went wide, but he was out of trouble and in the clear,\" said McLaughlin. \"It was a very good race. I don't care how he did it; to get here first was most important in this race.\"\n In the  , Frosted was the 5th betting choice in a field of 18. He broke poorly and was rank for the first quarter mile before finally settling near the back of the pack. He started to make up ground down the backstretch, raced very wide around the far turn, and closed steadily down the stretch to finish fourth, just over 3 lengths behind winner   and only a neck behind Dortmund and Firing Line \u00b1for fourth. \n Frosted skipped the Preakness Stakes to prepare for the  , in which American Pharoah was attempting to win the Triple Crown. Frosted stalked the pace and made his move as the rounded into the stretch. He quickly advanced into second place but proved no match for American Pharoah, who won by   lengths. Keen Ice would finish third, two lengths behind Frosted. \n Frosted's next start was on August 1 in the   at Saratoga. Only four horses went to the post as there were two defections to the  , which had an increased purse due to the presence of  .  Frosted raced in third for the first mile, and went wide around both turns. Coming into the stretch, Texas Red, winner of the 2014  , kicked clear of the field. Frosted closed hard but could not get by, settling for yet another second. \n In the  , Frosted pressed American Pharoah hard, especially from after the first half-mile, when the pace quickened significantly. The two horses bumped repeatedly around the turn and Frosted took a temporary lead.  This change from Frosted's previous stalking style was attributed to a rider change less than an hour before the race, when Jose Lezcano replaced an injured Joel Rosario. The unexpected tactics of Lezcano may have been decisive as neither horse had enough energy left after a fast opening mile to withstand the charge of Keen Ice down the stretch.  American Pharoah would finish second with Frosted in third.  \"We didn't want to engage (American Pharoah) that early but Jose rode him well,\" said McLaughlin. \"We always break well, but just try to sit third to fifth. He took it upon himself to go and engage him early because no one else was there. It was unfortunate for us and maybe for American Pharoah, too.\" \n On September 19, Frosted traveled to   for the  . Facing a field of 9 and with Joel Rosario again up, he returned to his usual tactics, stalking the pace for the first   of a mile. Going 3-wide around the final turn, Frosted took the lead coming into the stretch and won under a hand ride. \"He's a top horse and the last three out of his last four runs have been against American Pharoah, so it's great he wasn't here and we were able to shine today,\" McLaughlin said. \n On October 31, Frosted entered the  , facing older horses for the first time and American Pharoah for the last time. Frosted took up his normal stalking position several lengths behind American Pharoah, then started to make his move on the turn. But when trying to go between horses, he was bumped hard into the rail and tailed off, eventually finishing seventh. \n Frosted shipped to Dubai in early 2016 with the Dubai World Cup as the target. His first start was on February 4 in the   at a distance of 1900 metres (roughly   miles). Betting is illegal in Dubai,  but Frosted was the favorite in the American simulcast pool. He settled behind a slow pace, then made his move on the turn only to be fanned wide by the pacesetter. Frosted adjusted and drew away to win by 5 lengths in track record time. \n McLaughlin had originally considered racing Frosted in Round 3 of the Al Maktoum Challenge in early March, but ultimately decided to train Frosted up to the Dubai World Cup at Godolphin's Al Marmoon stables. \"It was the first time he had really run off an extended break and he set the track record in the process. He answered all the questions and he obviously runs well fresh,\" said McLaughlin. \n An international field of twelve horses went to the post on March 25 to contest the  .  , the 2014  , tracked the pace on the outside for about a mile before drawing clear to win in convincing fashion. Frosted was stalking a few lengths further back but had no response in the stretch and could only finish fifth. \"The race went well,\" said his jockey,  . \"We were tracking California Chrome the whole way, but Frosted came off the bridle a little bit early. He wasn't as good today and I'm not sure why.\" \n Frosted returned to the United States, and was originally set to return to racing in the   in early July. Frosted was training well though, so McLaughlin decided not to wait and entered Frosted in the  , more popularly known as the Met Mile, run on June 11.  Frosted stalked the pace, then made a four-wide move around the turn and burst clear of the field, drawing off to win by   lengths while geared down.  The winning margin is believed to be the largest in the 132-year history of the race, and Frosted's time of 1:32.73 was a new stakes record. The Daily Racing Form called it \"an absolutely scintillating performance.\"  After the race, McLaughin said it was one of the highlights of his training career:  \"Way up there in the top five, for sure. It's our biggest win for Godolphin ever... he's such a talented horse and has everything.\"  The win earned Frosted an automatic berth in the   as part of the   \"Win and You're In\" series. \n On August 6, Frosted entered the   mile   at Saratoga as the 1-2 favorite against a field of five other horses. He broke well and went to the early lead, joined by Upstart and Noble Bird. The opening fractions were fast but Frosted was moving comfortably and opened a lead coming into the stretch, winning with ease by two lengths. \"I knew he probably went a little too fast \u2014 more than normal,\" said Rosario. \"Sometimes he's a little difficult, and you have to let him do what he wants to do, but when I turned for home I knew I had something left because I know the way he likes to run.\" With the victory, Frosted earned a \"Win and You're In\" berth for the 2016 Breeders' Cup Classic, thus qualifying for two different Breeders' Cup races. \n Frosted next entered the   on September 3, where he was made the 2-5 favorite in a nine horse field. He broke poorly and raced in sixth place for the first half mile, further from the lead than was his custom. He started his move on the far turn, but was fanned extremely wide, losing a considerable amount of ground compared to horses running on the rail. Under a hand ride from Rosario, Frosted hit the lead in mid-stretch, only to have   and Mubtahiij close ground rapidly in the final furlong. At the wire, four horses were heads apart, with Frosted in third. \"It wasn't our day,\" said McLaughlin. \"He had a bad trip and the winner ran big.\"  Rosario was criticized for not riding harder, although McLaughlin defended him by pointing out the horse's longstanding aversion to the whip. McLaughlin also noted that under the allowance conditions of the race, Frosted carried 4 pounds more weight than the winner, Shaman Ghost, and six pounds more than the runner-up, Mubtahiij. \n Frosted trained up to the  , held at Santa Anita on November 5. His connections elected to enter him in the Classic, in which he was ranked behind both California Chrome and Arrogate, rather than entering him in the Dirt Mile, for which he would have been the likely favorite based on his performance in the Met Mile.  He was bumped at the start and again in the stretch and finished sixth. \n After the Classic, Frosted was retired to stud at  , the Kentucky division of Darley. His initial stud fee was $50,000.  It was announced Spring 2017 that Frosted would shuttle to Darley's stallion operation in   for the southern hemisphere breeding season. \n Frosted's first reported foal was a filly out of mare Snow Top Mountain born January 15 in Virginia. Snow Top Mountain won the   and   and also produced   winner Greyvitos by  . \n The first North American winner for Frosted was also a filly, a bay named Inject, who won on debut at   in August 2020. Inject is out of the mare Appealing Zophie, who won the   while racing and produced 2017   winner  . \n Colt Ingratiating was the first stakes winner worldwide for Frosted, and also his first stakes winner in Australia. \n Frosted's top progeny include: \n Frosted is by Tapit, the   in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Tapit's other notable offspring include champions  ,   and  , and   winner  . \n Frosted's dam Fast Cookie won on turf and dirt, at sprint and longer distances, including a win in the  .

Fast Cookie's dam is Fleet Lady, who was also a stakes winner at sprint and longer distances, including the  . In addition to Fast Cookie, Fleet Lady produced    . \n Frosted is inbred 4 \u00d7 4 to Seattle Slew, meaning Seattle Slew appears twice in the fourth generation of Frosted's pedigree. He is also inbred 5 \u00d7 4 to Northern Dancer, and 4 \u00d7 5 to Mr. Prospector.\n"},

The goal is to maximize enjoyment and engagement by capturing the interest of learners and inspiring them to continue learning.   , broadly defined, is the process of defining the elements which comprise games, make those games fun, and motivate players to continue playing, then using those same elements in a non-game context to influence behavior.  In other words, gamification is the introduction of game elements into a traditionally non-game situation.\n There are two forms of gamification: structural, which means no changes to subject matter, and the altered content method that adds subject matter.  Games applied in learning can be considered  , or games where the learning experience is centered around serious stories. A serious story needs to be both \"impressive in quality\" and \"part of a thoughtful process\" to achieve learning goals. \n In educational contexts, examples of desired student behavior as a result of gamification include attending class, focusing on meaningful learning tasks, and taking initiative. \n Gamification of learning does not involve students in designing and creating their own games or in playing commercially produced  , making it distinguishable from  , or using educational games to learn a concept. Within game-based learning initiatives, students might use   or   to create their own video game or explore and create 3D worlds in  . In these examples, the learning agenda is encompassed within the game itself.\n Some authors contrast gamification of learning with game-based learning. They claim that gamification occurs only when learning happens in a non-game context, such as a school classroom. Under this classification, when a series of game elements is arranged into a \"game layer,\" or a system which operates in coordination with learning in regular classrooms, then gamification of learning occurs.  Other examples of gamified content include games that are created to induce learning. \n Some elements of games that may be used to motivate learners and facilitate learning include:\n A more complete taxonomy of game elements used in educational contexts divide 21 game elements into five dimensions \n When a classroom incorporates the use of some of these elements, that environment can be considered \"gamified\". There is no distinction as to how many elements need to be included to officially constitute gamification, but a guiding principle is that gamification takes into consideration the complex system of reasons a person chooses to act, and not just one single factor.  Progress mechanics, which need not make use of advanced technology, are often thought of as constituting a gamified system  However, used in isolation, these points and opportunities to earn achievements are not necessarily effective motivators for learning.  Engaging video games which can keep players playing for hours on end do not maintain players' interest by simply offering the ability to earn points and beat levels. Rather, the story that carries players along, the chances for players to connect and collaborate with others, the immediate feedback, the increasing challenges, and the powerful choices given to players about how to proceed throughout the game, are immensely significant factors in sustained engagement. Business initiatives designed to use gamification to retain and recruit customers, but do not incorporate a creative and balanced approach to combining game elements, may be destined to fail.  Similarly, in learning contexts, the unique needs of each set of learners, along with the specific learning objectives relevant to that context must inform the combination of game elements to shape a compelling gamification system that has the potential to motivate learners. \n A system of game elements which operates in the classroom is explicit, and consciously experienced by the students in the classroom. There is no hidden agenda by which teachers attempt to   or trick students into doing something. Students still make autonomous choices to participate in learning activities. The progress mechanics used in the gamified system can be thought of as lighting the way for learners as they progress,  and the other game mechanics and elements of game design are set up as an immersive system to support and maximize students' learning. \n Gamification initiatives in learning contexts acknowledge that large numbers of school-aged children play video games, which shapes their   as people and as learners.  While the world of gaming used to be skewed heavily toward male players, recent statistics show that slightly more than half of videogame players are male: in the United States, 59% male, 41% female, and  52% male, 48% female in Canada.  Within games and other digital media, students experience opportunities for autonomy, competence and relatedness,  and these   are what they have come to expect from such environments. Providing these same opportunities in the classroom environment is a way to acknowledge students' reality, and to acknowledge that this reality affects who they are as learners.  Incorporating elements from games into classroom scenarios is a way to provide students with opportunities to act autonomously, to display competence, and to learn in relationship to others.  Game elements are a familiar language that children speak, and an additional channel through which teachers can communicate with their students.\n Game designer   characterizes video game players as urgent optimists who are part of a social fabric, engaged in blissful productivity, and on the lookout for epic meaning.  If teachers can successfully organize their classrooms and curriculum activities to incorporate the elements of games which facilitate such confidence, purpose and integrated sense of mission, students may become engrossed in learning and collaborating such that they do not want to stop. The dynamic combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators is a powerful force  which, if educational contexts can adapt from video games, may increase student  , and student learning.\n Some of the potential benefits of successful gamification initiatives in the classroom include: \n Referring to how video games provide increasingly difficult challenges to players, game designer   has suggested that every educational scenario could be set up to operate this way.  This game mechanic which involves tracking players' learning in the game, and responding by raising the difficulty level of tasks at just the right moment, keeps players from becoming unnecessarily frustrated with tasks that are too difficult, as well as keeps players from becoming bored with tasks that are too easy. This pacing fosters continued engagement and interest which can mean that learners are focused on educational tasks, and may get into a state of  , or deeply absorbed in learning. \n In gamified e-learning platforms, massive amount of data are generated as a result of user interaction and action within the system. These actions and interactions can be properly sampled, recorded, and analyzed. Meaningful insights on performance behaviors and learning objectives can be useful to teachers, learners, and application developers to improve the learning. These insights can be in form of a quick feedback to learners on the learning objectives while the learner still operates within the rules of play. Data generated from games can also be used to uncover patterns and rules to improve the gamified e-learning experience. \n In a large systematic review of the literature regarding the application of gamification in Higher Education benefits where identified such as positive effects in student engagement, attitude, performance, and enjoyment although these are mediated by the context and design. \n Three key ways in which a classroom,  , or unit can be gamified are through changing the language, adapting the   process, and modifying the structure of the learning environment. With regard to language, instead of referring to academic requirements with the typical associated terms, game-like names may be used instead. For example, making a course presentation might be referred to as \"embarking on a quest\", writing an exam might be \"defeating monsters\", and creating a prototype might be classed as \"completing a mission\". In terms of grading, the grading scheme for a course might be adapted to make use of   (XP) as opposed to letter grades. Each student can begin at level one with zero points; as they progress through the course, completing missions and demonstrating learning, they earn XP. A chart can be developed to illustrate how many XP is required to earn a letter grade. For example, earning 1500 XP might translate to a C, while 2000 would earn a B, and 2500, an A. Some teachers use XP, as well as health points (HP) and knowledge points (KP) to motivate students in the classroom, but do not connect these points with the letter grades students get on a report card. Instead these points are connected with earning virtual rewards such as badges or trophies. \n The structure of a course or unit may be adapted in various ways to incorporate elements of gamification; these adaptations can affect the role of the student, the role of the teacher, and role of the learning environment. The role of a student in a gamified environment might be to adopt an   and a game name with which they navigate through their learning tasks. Students may be organized into teams or  , and be invited to embark on learning quests with their fellow guild members. They may be encouraged to help other guild members, as well as those in other guilds, if they have mastered a learning task ahead of others. Students tend to express themselves as one of the following game-player types; player (motivated by extrinsic rewards), socialiser (motivated by relatedness), free spirit (motivated by autonomy), achiever (motivated by mastery) and philanthropist (motivated by purpose).  The role of the teacher is to design a gamified application, embedding game dynamics and mechanics that appeal to the target group (i.e. students) and provide the type of rewards that are attractive to the motivation of the majority.  Therefore, it is important teachers know their students so they are able to best design a gamififed program that not only interests the students but also one in which matches the specific learning goals that hit on elements of knowledge from the curriculum.  The teacher also needs to responsibly track student achievements with a web-based platform, such as  , the WordPress plug-in GameOn or an  . The teacher may also publish a   online which illustrates the students who have earned the most XP, or reached the highest level of play. The teacher may define the parameters of the classroom \"game\", giving the ultimate learning goal a name, defining the learning tasks which make up the unit or the course, and specifying the rewards for completing those tasks. The other important role of the teacher is to provide encouragement and guidance for students as they navigate the gamified environment.\n The role of a gamified learning environment may be structured to provide an overarching narrative which functions as a context for all the learning activities. For example, a narrative might involve an impending   attack which can be fended off or a murder mystery which can be solved, ultimately, through the process of learning. Learning is the focus of each gamified system. Sometimes the narrative is related to the content being learned, for example, in the case of a disease outbreak which can be stopped through learning biology. In some cases the narrative is unrelated, as in a case of music students who learn to play pieces as the means to collectively climb up to the top of a mountain, experiencing various challenges and setbacks along the way. Other ways in which gaming elements are part of the role of the learning environment include theme music played at opportune times, a continuous feedback loop which, if not instantaneous, is as quick as possible, a variety of individual and collaborative challenges, and the provision of choice as to which learning activities are undertaken, how they will be undertaken, or in which order they will be undertaken. \n Without adding extra gaming elements to the classroom, schooling already contains some elements which are analogous to games.   Since the 1700s, school has presented opportunities for students to earn marks for handing in assignments and completing exams,  which are a form of reward points. Since the early 1900s, with the advent of  , reward management programs were developed and can still be seen in schools. For example, many teachers set up reward programs in their classrooms which allow students to earn free time, school supplies or treats for finishing homework or following classroom rules. \n Teaching machines with gamification features were developed by cyberneticist   from 1956 onwards, after he was granted a patent for an \"Apparatus for assisting an operator in performing a skill\".  Based on this patent, Pask and Robin McKinnon-Wood built SAKI \u2013 the Self-Adaptive Keyboard Instructor \u2013 for  teaching students how to use the Hollerith key punch, a data entry device using punched cards. The punched card was common until the 1970s and there was huge demand for skilled operators. SAKI treats the student as a \"black box\", building a probabilistic model of their performance as it goes.  The machine stores the response times for different exercises, repeating exercises for which the operator has the slowest average response time, and increasing the difficulty of exercises where the operator has performed successfully. SAKI could train an expert key-punch operator in four to six weeks, a reduction of between 30 and 50 percent over other methods. \"Ideally, for an operator to perform a skill efficiently, the data presented to him should always be of sufficient complexity to maintain his interest and maintain a competitive situation, but not so complex as to discourage the operator\".  SAKI led to the development of teaching software such as the Mavis Beacon typing tutor,  fondly remembered by students of touch-typing everywhere.\n While some have criticized the term \"gamification\" then, as simply a new name for a practice that has been used in education for many years,  gamification does not refer to a one-dimensional system where a reward is offered for performing a certain behaviour. The gamification of learning is an approach which recently has evolved, in coordination with technological developments, to include much larger scales for gameplay, new tools, and new ways to connect people.  The term gamification, coined in 2002, is not a one-dimensional reward system. Rather, it takes into consideration the variety of complex factors which make a person decide to do something; it is a multifaceted approach which takes into consideration psychology, design, strategy, and technology.  One reason for the popularization of the term \"gamification\" is that current advancements in technology, in particular, mobile technology have allowed for the explosion of a variety of gamification initiatives in many contexts. Some of these contexts include the   and   loyalty programs, location-based check-in applications such as  , and mobile and web applications and tools that reward and broadcast healthy eating, drinking, and exercise habits, such as  ,   and  . These examples involve the use of game elements such as points, badges and leaderboards to motivate behavioural changes and track those changes in online platforms. The gamification of learning is related to these popular initiatives, but specifically focuses on the use of game elements to facilitate student engagement and motivation to learn. It is difficult to pinpoint when gamification, in the strict sense of the term, came to be used in educational contexts, although examples shared online by classroom teachers begin appearing in 2010. \n The research of Dom\u00ednguez and colleagues about gamifying learning experiences suggests that common beliefs about the benefits obtained when using games in education can be challenged. Students who completed the gamified experience got better scores in practical assignments and in overall score, but their findings also suggest that these students performed poorly on written assignments and participated less on class activities, although their initial motivation was higher. The researchers concluded that gamification in e-learning platforms seems to have the potential to increase student motivation, but that it is not trivial to achieve that effect, as a big effort is required in the design and implementation of the experience for it to be fully motivating for participants. On the one hand, qualitative analysis of the study suggests that gamification can have a great emotional and social impact on students, as reward systems and competitive social mechanisms seem to be motivating for them. But quantitative analysis suggests that the cognitive impact of gamification on students is not very significant. Students who followed traditional exercises performed similarly in overall score than those who followed gamified exercises. Disadvantages of gamified learning were reported by 57 students who did not want to participate in the gamified experience. The most frequent reason argued by students was 'time availability'. The second most important reason were technical problems. Other reasons were that there were too many students and that they had to visit so many   and applications at the university that they did not want to use a new one. \n Another field where serious games are used to improve learning is health care. Petit dit Dariel, Raby, Ravaut and Rothan-Tondeur investigated the developing of serious games potential in nursing education. They suggest that few nursing students have long-term exposure to home-care and community situations. New pedagogical tools are needed to adequately and consistently prepare nurses for the skills they will need to care for patients outside acute care settings. Advances in information and communications technologies offer an opportunity to explore innovative pedagogical solutions that could help students develop these skills in a safe environment. Laboratory simulations with high fidelity mannequins, for example, have become an integral element in many health care curricula.  A recent systematic review found evidence suggesting that the use of simulation mannequins significantly improved three outcomes integral to clinical reasoning: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking and the ability to identify deteriorating patients. \n In the study of Mouaheb, Fahli, Moussetad and Eljamali an American version of a serious game was investigated: Virtual University. Results showed that learning using this serious game has educational values that are based on learning concepts advocated by constructivist psycho-cognitive theories. It guarantees intrinsic motivation, generates cognitive conflicts and provides situated learning. The use of Virtual University allowed the researchers to identify the following key points: from its playfulness combined with video game technologies, the tool was able to motivate learners intrinsically; the simulation game also recreates learning situations extremely close to that of reality, especially considering the complexity, dynamism and all of the interrelations and interactions that exist within the university system. This is a major educational advantage by encouraging 1) an intense interaction that generates real cognitive or socio-cognitive conflicts, providing a solid construction of knowledge; 2) an autonomy in the learning process following a strong metacognitive activity; 3) an eventual transfer of acquired skills. \n In another study involving an American-based school,\u00a0gamification was integrated into all its subjects. Both students and teachers indicated they derived maximum satisfaction from a gamified form of learning. However, results from standardized tests showed a slightly improved performance, and in some cases, below-average performance in comparison to other schools.  Enough evidence-based research needs to be carried out to objectively measure the effectiveness of gamification of learning across varying factors. \n Multiple legal restrictions may apply to the gamification of learning because of the difference in laws in different countries and states. However, there are common laws prevalent in most jurisdictions.\n Administrators and instructors must ensure the privacy rights of learners are protected. The use of Personally Identifiable Information(PII) of learners and other user-generated data should be clearly stated in a privacy policy made available to all learners.\n Gamified e-learning systems can make use of existing game elements such as avatars and badges. Educators should be aware of the copyright protection guiding the use of such elements and ensure they are not in violation. Permission should be obtained from the creators of existing game items under copyright protection. In some cases, educators can create their game elements for use in such gamified e-learning systems. \n , a corporation which manufactures e-learning toys,   and games for children, was the subject of a hacking scandal involving its product LeapPad Ultimate, a rugged gaming and e-learning tablet featuring educational games for young users. The tablet had security errors that allowed third-parties to message users, scrape personal information from users and get into the   of users, most of whom were minors. This led to concerns regarding   using the tablets as a way to groom potential victims. \n Gamification of learning has been criticized for its use of extrinsic motivators, which some teachers believe must be avoided since they have the potential to decrease intrinsic motivation for learning (see  ). This idea is based on research which emerged first in the early 1970s  and has been recently made popular by  . \n Some teachers may criticize gamification for taking a less than serious approach to education. This may be a result of the historical distinction between work and play which perpetuates the notion that the classroom cannot be a place for games, or a place for fun.  Gameplay in some views may be seen as being easy, irrelevant to learning, and applicable only to very young children. \n Teachers who criticize the gamification of learning might feel that it is not worth their time to implement gaming initiatives, either because they themselves are stretched thin with the number of responsibilities that they already have,  or because they fear that the curriculum might not be covered if any time is spent dedicated to anything other than engagement with that curriculum. Gamification of learning has been also criticized as ineffective for certain learners and for certain situations. .  Videogame theorist   has criticized gamification for its tendency to take a simplistic, manipulative approach which does not reflect the real quality of complex, motivational games. Educational scenarios which purport to be gamification, but only make use of progress mechanics such as points, badges and leaderboards are particularly susceptible to such criticism. \n Gamification in education has also raised concerns over inequity in the classroom. A lack of access to technology, students who do not like gaming, and students in large schools where the teachers do not know each student on an individual level may affect any educational benefit to come from gamification, and gamification may not be appropriate for every subject in school. For example, sensitive or controversial subject matter such as racial history or human rights may not be an appropriate space for gamification. \n There are growing concerns about ethical constraints surrounding implementation of gamification using ICT tools and e-learning systems. Gaming elements, like points and badges, can encourage collaboration and social competition but can also encourage aggression amongst learners. More so, the policies guiding the privacy and security of data produced in gamified e-learning systems needs to be transparent to all stakeholders including students and administrators.  Teachers and students need to be aware and accept to participate in any gamified form of learning introduced in the curriculum. Any possible risks that may arise should be made available to all participants prior to their participation. Also, Educators should have an understanding of the target audience of the learners to maintain fairness. Educators need to ensure gaming elements and rules integrated in gamification design do not impair learners' participation because of their social, cultural or physical conditions. \n"},

It is located in the same region as the smaller but more famous and accessible  . It took second place after Milford Sound as New Zealand's most famous tourism destination. \n At 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) long, Doubtful Sound / Patea is the second longest, and with a depth of up to 421 metres (1,381\u00a0ft) the deepest of the South Island's fiords.   In comparison with Milford Sound, it is more widespread, with the cliffs not as dramatically tall and near vertical.  However, the U-shaped profile of the fiord is obvious, in particular on the two innermost of the main fiord's arms and the hanging side valleys along the main fiord.\n Like most of Fiordland, Doubtful Sound receives a high amount of rainfall, ranging from an annual average of 3,000\u20136,000 millimetres (120\u2013240\u00a0in).   The vegetation on the mountainous landscape surrounding the fiord is dense native rainforest.\n Doubtful Sound was named 'Doubtful Harbour' in 1770 by  , who did not enter the inlet as he was uncertain whether it was navigable under sail.  It was later renamed Doubtful Sound by   and  , although it is not technically a   but a fiord.\n A Spanish scientific expedition commanded by   visited Doubtful Sound in February 1793 to conduct experiments measuring the force of gravity using a  , a part of the effort to establish a new metric system.  The officers of the expedition, which included  , a cartographer,  also made the first chart of the entrance and lower parts of the Sound, naming features of it. Today these form a unique cluster containing most of the Spanish names on the map of New Zealand: Febrero Point,   and the Nee Islets, Pendulo Reach, and Malaspina Reach. \n Following the passage of the  , the name of the fiord was officially altered to Doubtful Sound / Patea. \n Doubtful Sound lies deep within the  , about 50 kilometres (31\u00a0mi) from the nearest inhabited place, the small town of  , and is surrounded by mountainous terrain with peaks typically reaching 1,300\u20131,600 metres (4,300\u20135,200\u00a0ft).  Along the coast, there are no settlements for about 200 kilometres (120\u00a0mi) in either direction.\n There are three distinct arms to the sound, which all extend to the south from the main fiord. From the major conflux of water just south of  , these arms are:\n Crooked Arm reaches to within 1 kilometre (0.62\u00a0mi) of  ,  almost cutting off a landmass of about 195 square kilometres (75\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). \n The Sound is the site of several large  , notably Helena Falls at   and the  , which have a fall of over 600 metres (2,000\u00a0ft). The steep hills surrounding the main fiord and its arms are known for their hundreds of waterfalls during the rainy season.\n Doubtful Sound contains about a dozen smaller islands, with the more notable ones being  , Fergusson Island,  Bauza Island, and the Shelter Islands.  Parts of the sound on the west side of Elizabeth Island are protected by the  .\n The last quarter of the sound closest to the sea is dominated by islands, the major one being Secretary Island to the north. At the southernmost tip of the island, Doubtful Sound opens up as a confluence of 5 bodies of water. From the western seaward end and going clockwise, these are:\n The narrow, shallower area of the sound between Bauza Island and Secretary Island (\"The Gut\") offers more shelter than areas further to the west and towards the sea. It is a popular fishing and mooring location and is a haven for crayfish.\n Thompson Sound and Bradshaw Sound join in a short stretch named \"Pendulo Reach\"  southeast of Secretary Island, and containing the tiny Seymour Island. \n Access to the sound is either by sea or via the isolated   road from the  . Most areas of the sound itself are accessible only by sea, however, as the road network in this area of New Zealand is sparse or nonexistent, as is the human population.\n , 10th  ,   (1957\u20131962) wrote about this part of Fiordland:\n Doubtful Sound (like many of the fiords in the area) is unusual in that it contains two distinct layers of water that scarcely mix. The surface layer 2\u201310 metres (5\u201335\u00a0ft), referred to as the Low Salinity Layer or LSL, consists of diluted seawater with a typical salinity value of less than 10 psu.  This layer receives fresh water fed from the high inflows from the surrounding mountains, and stained brown with tannins from the forest. The outflow of freshwater from the tailrace discharge from the Manapouri Power Station also influences the thickness of the LSL. Below the LSL is a layer of warmer, undiluted seawater with a salinity value of around 35 psu.  The dark tannins in the fresh water layer make it difficult for light to penetrate. Thus, many deep-sea species grow in the comparatively shallow depths of the Sound.  Such species include    ,  which is normally found at depths of 30\u201340 metres (100\u2013130\u00a0ft) but can be found at just 10 metres (35\u00a0ft) in Doubtful Sound and is within the range of qualified recreational divers.\n The catchment basin of Doubtful Sound is generally steep terrain that is heavily forested except for locations where surface rock exposures are extensive.   trees are dominant in many locations. In the understory there are a wide variety of shrubs and  , including the  ,  . \n The fiord is home to one of the southernmost populations of  . The Doubtful Sound bottlenoses have formed a very insular subgroup of only about 70 individuals, with none having been observed to leave or enter the Sound during a multi-year monitoring regime. Their social grouping is thus extremely close, which is also partly attributed to the difficult and unusual features of their habitat, which is much colder than the habitats of other bottlenose groups and is also overlaid by the freshwater layer.  Recently (2000s), there has been growing concern that the population is in significant decline, with calf survival rates having halved, as well as being noticeably lower than in captivity or in other New Zealand environments. The reasons for this are unclear, though increased tourism and the fresh-water discharge from the Manapouri Power Station (see Hydroelectricity section below) are considered potential causes. \n Other wildlife to be found in Doubtful Sound includes   and  , or even large  .    and   are the most frequently seen especially the later.  Others include  ,   and some  ). Orcas ( ) and   can be found also. The waters of Doubtful Sound are also home to an abundance of sea creatures, including many species of  ,  ,  , and  . It is perhaps best known for its   trees which occur in unusually shallow water for what is normally a deep-water species. The sound has been identified as an   by   because it is a breeding site for  . \nSecretary Island and Bauza Island are some of the most important sanctuaries in New Zealand for critically endangered birds.\n  ( ), the innermost end of Doubtful Sound, is the site of discharge of water from the Manapouri Power Station's tailrace tunnels. Deep Cove, like the rest of Fiordland, is a unique and mostly pristine environment. The discharge of clear fresh water has affected fauna and flora by letting light into the lower layers of the sound.  Nevertheless, this is an area naturally high in fresh water inflows (7.6 metres (24\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) of rain falls annually).\n The small wharf at Deep Cove is on rare occasion also used to unload any equipment for the Manapouri Power Station that is too large to be ferried across  .  From Deep Cove, such equipment then has to be hauled over Wilmot Pass to the power station. \n Unlike the more easily accessible Milford Sound, it is not possible to drive to Doubtful Sound, as the Wilmot Pass road is not connected to the road network and only connects the Manapouri Hydro Power Station with Deep Cove.\n The only options for visitors to visit Doubtful Sound are boat cruises. The less common way to access Doubtful Sound is by sea.  However, there are some boat cruises that operate out of the small town of Manapouri. These day trips first take a boat across Lake Manapouri and then a bus on the gravel road across Wilmot Pass to the Sound, where the Doubtful Sound tour boats berth at a small wharf in Deep Cove.  The tour companies offer a day option out of Te Anau/Manapouri or an overnight option.\n"},

It originated in the early 1970s as the personal setting of  , the co-creator of  , as an early testing ground for what would become  .\n Blackmoor began as a development of  's \" \" games following Duane Jenkins' Brownstone (Old West) variant and Arneson's own wargaming sessions, into which  he had begun to introduce fantasy elements.    Initially inspired by Conan novels and gothic horror, Arneson expanded the setting around the eponymous town, castle, and multi-level dungeon to include ideas from   and   and applied the Fantasy Supplement rules from the   game.  Blackmoor was a campaign centered on individual player characters capable of a series of progressions, which encouraged cooperative play to succeed.  D. H. Boggs suggested a possible influence of the film  , as inspiration for Blackmoor as it was aired twice before the first game,  and it was mentioned by Dave Arneson as a film he was possibly watching while reading Conan. \n The origins of the Blackmoor setting lie in the  , a subgroup of the   specializing in medieval miniatures combat; the group was initially driven by  . Dave Arneson was among the first to join the Society in April 1970, and many other members of his   gaming group followed, including Duane Jenkins, Bill Hoyt, Ed Werncke,  , and Marshall Hoegfeldt. Within months, the leadership of the Society had decided to form a fictional \"Great Kingdom\", with parcels of land awarded to and contested by members of the organization. Arneson assumed responsibility for the far northern reaches of the Great Kingdom, and it was there that he began to stage medieval games that led up to the Blackmoor setting. An announcement in Arneson's fanzine   describes the first game in the campaign, one built on the model of  's \" \" series of games:\n There will be a medieval \"Braunstein\" April 17, 1971, at the home of Dave Arneson from 1300 hrs to 2400 hrs with refreshments being available on the usual basis.\u00a0... It will feature mythical creatures and a Poker game under the Troll's bridge between sunup and sundown. The next issue of   promised \"the start of the 'Black Moors' battle reports, a series dealing with the perils of living in Medieval Europe\".  Initially, The Northern Marches was set up to be an ongoing multiplayer wargame, with the potential for Braunstein games. The Barony of Blackmoor formed the centerpiece of the game, and the various players attached to it (Greg Svenson,  , Dan Nicholson, Duane Jenkins ), initially represented the forces of good. Duane Jenkins, for example, ruled the Northern Marches, first as a bandit chief, later promoted to Baron as Sir Jenkins. As the game progressed, more of Arneson's Napoleonics players joined in increasingly diverse roles. Mike Carr, for example, became a village priest, and then Bishop of Blackmoor. Others chose early in the campaign to side with the forces of evil, such as a wizard played by John Soukup. Early descriptions of the activities of the Blackmoor campaign circulated in a news sheet called the  .  Players became increasingly drawn to the innovative dungeon exploration mechanic that Arneson invented; by 1972, that had become a major focus of the game. As demand for Blackmoor increased, Arneson fielded out refereeing duties to other players in his local circle.\n In the summer of 1972, Arneson famously wrote an article detailing \"Facts about Black Moor\" for   #13, which brought his innovations to the attention of the rest of the  . That fall, Arneson demonstrated the game for Gygax, and work on   commenced. As rule development proceeded, the Blackmoor campaign continued, and began coordinating with a parallel campaign known as   run out of   by Gygax and his circle.  After the publication of  , the Blackmoor campaign continued, but as a number of key participants (including Arneson) left Minneapolis to work in Lake Geneva, play of the campaign grew more sporadic.\n The original   product was published by   (TSR) in 1975, as the second supplement to   (the first being  ). The booklet was named for the original role-playing campaign world by Dave Arneson, who also wrote this booklet.  It added rules, monsters, treasure, and the first published role-playing game adventure, the \"Temple of the Frog\", a scenario from the Loch Gloomen section of the Blackmoor campaign.  Other than the \"Temple of the Frog\",   did not include any information on the Blackmoor setting itself.\n Written by Dave Arneson and published by   in 1977,   added information on the actual Blackmoor campaign setting. It included baronies, citadels, history of leaders and details on the Blackmoor dungeon. It also contained additional rules for creating lairs, character interests and vocations. \n  anthologizes material produced at various stages of the Blackmoor campaign, from Magic Swords (1971) up to the Blackmoor dungeons Arneson commonly ran at conventions in 1976. Only a relatively small amount of original material, primarily link text, was written specifically for the  , though all maps and some connected illustrations were redrawn and relettered by the Judges Guild's  . Thus, the   is a rich repository of pre-  material which preserves original rules and campaign events. For example, it contains the entirety of the \"Facts about Black Moor\" article from Domesday Book #13.  It also contains circa-1972 price lists as well as rules dating from the exile of the Blackmoor Bunch to Loch Gloomen in the late Spring of 1972.\n The 1977 first printing, including its cover, is in black and white. The cover says \"The First Fantasy Campaign Playing Aid\" with \"Playing Aid\" as a subtitle. It shows a large mostly circular picture with trees in the foreground and a fire elemental in the background, below which it says \"by Dave Arneson\" and \"Judges Guild\". There is no other verbiage on the cover and the price does not appear on the cover. The back cover has a product list titled \"Booty List\" with the highest number being 35 and \"New Non-Sub Items\" listing product numbers 36\u201339. It comes with the first printing of the First Fantasy Campaign Maps. This book consists of 92 numbered pages plus the cover, inside cover, back cover and table of contents for a total of 96 total pages. The dark red cover was used for the reformatted later printings that used a smaller font and fewer pages.\n Arneson left TSR in the early 1980s, but Blackmoor remained a part of   lore and was referred to in many later supplements. In a subsequent re-release of the world of   for the   game, an arctic region of mysterious black ice in the northwestern area of the map was called  . However, Arneson's Blackmoor became integral to a different setting and rules system, those of the   game.\n For various reasons, TSR published two different versions of their flagship game line. Over the course of several supplements, the   developed its own campaign setting, referred to at first simply as the Known World and later as  . When the history of Mystara was codified, it was established that Arneson's Blackmoor had existed in the world's distant past, achieved a technologically advanced civilization, and then destroyed itself in a global catastrophe that shifted the planet's axis.\n Its influence was now central to at least one of TSR's published worlds, but the actual setting of Blackmoor as Arneson described it had yet to be presented. This was finally remedied in the mid-1980s through the DA series of  , which carried a party of adventurers into Mystara's past to visit Blackmoor. The first of these, DA1  , described in general the geography and politics of Blackmoor and the means by which the characters travel there. DA2   expanded the scenario that had appeared in the original Blackmoor supplement. DA3   explored the starship crashed near the Kingdom of Blackmoor, from which the setting's intentional anachronisms derived. DA4   dealt with a horde of invading barbarians, but was the only work not derived from Dave Arneson's original campaign notes. A fifth installment, DA5  , was announced but was never written or published.\n There were no further direct explorations of Blackmoor, although later   products continued to make reference to it. For instance,  , an epic adventure which described a massive war involving both heaven and earth, climaxes with the discovery of the preserved control room from the starship that had crashed near Blackmoor millennia ago.\n After the   game and its Mystara setting were discontinued, Zeitgeist Games, where Arneson worked prior to his death, produced an updated   version of Blackmoor titled  , published by   in 2004.  Goodman and Zeitgeist also produced Blackmoor adventure modules. In 2009 Code Monkey Publishing released  , an updated campaign guide for the 4th edition of  . \n There was also an ongoing   campaign organized by Zeitgeist games, which is similar in form to the   organized by the  .

The study of education equity is often linked with the study of  .\n Educational equity depends on two main factors. The first is  , which implies that factors specific to one's personal conditions should not interfere with the potential of academic success. The second factor is  , which refers to a comprehensive standard that applies to everyone in a certain education system. These two factors are closely related and depend on each other for an educational system's success.  \n Educational equity's growing importance is based on the premise that an person's level of education directly correlates with their   and that an academic system that practices educational equity is thus a strong foundation for a fair and thriving society. But   is hard to avoid because of inequities in socioeconomic standing, race, gender, and disability. Educational equity also operates in a historical context.  History can shape outcomes in education systems. \n The terms \"equity\" and \"equality\" are often interchanged when referring to educational equity, but there can be important distinctions between them. \n Equity recognizes that some are at a larger disadvantage than others and aims to compensate for this to ensure that everyone can attain the same lifestyle.  Examples of this are: \"When libraries offer literacy programs, when schools offer courses in English as a second language, and when foundations target scholarships to students from poor families, they operationalize a belief in equity of access as fairness and as justice\".  Equity recognizes this uneven playing field and aims to take extra measures by giving those in need more than those who are not. Equity aims to achieve equal outcomes for groups, also called  .  Equity aims to ensure that everyone's lifestyle is equal, even if that requires unequal distribution of access and goods.    in education strive to ensure equitable outcomes for their students. \n The   defines equality as \"access to channels of communication and sources of information that is made available on even terms to all\".  On this definition, no one has an unfair advantage. Everyone has equal opportunities and accessibility and is then free to do what they please. This is not to say that everyone is then inherently equal. Some people may choose to seize opportunities while others let them pass. \n  systems are selective measures to find students at different educational levels.  They are created to increase education's  .  They allow more or less   groups of students to receive education that suits their skills.  Tracking can affect educational equity if the selection process is   and children with certain backgrounds are structurally put on lower tracks.  Students can be viewed and treated differently depending on their track, generating unequal achievement levels and restricting access to higher tracks and higher education.  The quality of teaching and curricula vary between tracks and those on lower tracks may be disadvantaged with inferior resources, teachers, etc.  In many cases, tracking stunts students who may develop the ability to excel past their original placement. \n The type of tracking has impact on the level of educational equity, which is especially determined by the degree in which the system is  . Less differentiated systems, such as standardized   schools, reach higher levels of equity in comparison to more differentiated, or tracked, systems. \n Within the tracked systems, the kind of differentiation matters as well for educational equity. Differentiation of schools could be organized externally or internally.  External differentiation means that tracks are separated in different schools. Certain schools follow a certain track, which prepares students for academic or   education, or for career or   education. This form is less beneficial for educational equity than internal differentiation or course-by-course tracking.  Internal tracking means that, within a single school, courses are instructed at different levels, which is a less rigid kind of tracking that allows for more mobility. \n The organization of the tracking systems themselves is also important for its effect on educational equity. For both differentiation systems, a higher number of tracks and a smaller number of students per track is granting more educational equity.  In addition, the effects of tracking are less rigid and have a smaller impact on equity if the students are located in tracks when they are older.  The earlier the students undergo educational selection, the less mobile they are to develop their abilities and the less they can benefit from   effects. \n Income has always played an important role in shaping academic success. Those who come from a family of a higher   (SES) are privileged with more opportunities than those of lower SES. Those who come from a higher SES can afford things like better tutors, rigorous  /  prep classes, impressive summer programs, and so on. Parents generally feel more comfortable intervening on behalf of their children to acquire better grades or more qualified teachers (Levitsky).  Parents of a higher SES are more willing to donate large sums of money to a certain institution to better improve their child's chances of acceptance, along with other extravagant measures.  This creates an unfair advantage and distinct class barrier.\n The extraordinarily high cost of the many prestigious high schools and universities in the United States makes an attempt at a \"level playing field\" for all students not so level. High-achieving low-income students do not have the means to attend   that better prepare a student for later success.  Because of this, low-income students do not even attempt to apply to the top-tier schools for which they are more than qualified. In addition, neighborhoods generally   by class leave lower-income students in lower-quality schools. For higher-quality schooling, students in low-income areas would have to take public transport which they cannot pay for.  Fewer than 30 percent of students in the bottom quarter of incomes even enroll in a four-year school and among that group, fewer than half graduate. \n From a scientific point of view, humanity is a single species. Nevertheless, the term racial group is enshrined in legislation, and phrases such as race equality and race relations are in widespread official use.  Racial equity in education means the assignment of students to   and within schools without regard to their race. This includes providing students with a full opportunity for participation in all educational programs regardless of their race. \n The educational system and its response to racial concerns in education vary from country to country. Below are some examples of countries that have to deal with racial  . \n The struggle for equality of access to formal education and equality of excellent educational outcomes is part of the history of education in this country and is tied up with the economic, political, social history of the peoples who are part of it. From the beginning of this nation, there were many barriers to the schooling and education of girls and racial, national origin, and language groups not from the dominant culture. Approaches and resources for achieving equality and equity in the public schooling of girls and ethnic, racial, and language minority groups are still evolving. \n Higher education plays a vital role in preparing students for the employment market and active citizenship both nationally and internationally. By embedding race equality in teaching and learning, institutions can ensure that they acknowledge the experiences and values of all students, including minority ethnic and international students.  Universities Scotland first published the Race Equality Toolkit: learning and teaching in 2006 in response to strong demand from the universities in Scotland for guidance on meeting their statutory obligations. \n Gender equity in practicality refers to both male and female concerns, yet most of the gender bias is against women in the developing world. Gender discrimination in education has been very evident and underlying problem in many countries, especially in   where cultural and societal stigma continue to hinder growth and prosperity for women.   (GCE) followed a survey called \"Gender Discrimination in Violation of Rights of Women and Girls\" states that one tenth of girls in primary school are 'unhappy' and this number increases to one fifth by the time they reach secondary schools. Some of the reasonings that girls provided include harassment, restorations to freedom, and an inherent lack of opportunities, compared to boys. \nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( ) understands Education as a \" fundamental human right and essential for the exercise of all other human rights. It promotes individual freedom and empowerment and yields important development benefits.\" \n UN Special Rapporteur Katarina Tomasevki developed the '4A' framework on the Right to Education. The '4A' framework encompasses availability, accessibility, acceptability and adaptability as fundamental to the institution of education. And yet girls in many underdeveloped countries are denied secondary education. \nFigure on the right shows the discrepancies in secondary education in the world. Countries such as  ,  ,   and   face the highest of inequity when it comes to gender bias. \n Gender-based inequity in education is not just a phenomenon in developing countries. An article in   highlighted how education systems, especially the public school system, tend to cause segregation between genders.\n , an independent international development organization that works towards eliminating poverty, published a paper that categorizes the obstacles (or causes) into:\n Education is universally acknowledged as an essential human right because it highly impacts the socio-economic and cultural aspects of a country. Equity in education increases the work force of the nation, therefore increasing  ,  , and [gross domestic product]. It reduces fertility and  , improves child health, increases life expectancy and increases standards of living.  These are factors that allow   and growth in the future. Above all, female education can increase output levels and allow countries to attain sustainable development. Equity in education of women also reduces the possibilities of trafficking and exploitation of women. UNESCO also refers gender equity as a major factor that allows for  . \n \"Looking at recently-published UN statistics on gender inequality in education, one observes that the overall picture has improved dramatically over the last decade, but progress has not been even (see chart). Although the developing world on average looks likely to hit the UN's gender-inequality target, many parts of Africa are lagging behind. While progress is being made in sub-Saharan Africa in primary education, gender inequality is in fact widening among older children. The ratio of girls enrolled in primary school rose from 85 to 93 per 100 boys between 1999 and 2010, whereas it fell from 83 to 82 and from 67 to 63 at the secondary and tertiary levels.\" \n Providing opportunities for students to consider racial equality as well as matters of racism as part of their study will help them to develop confidence to engage with these concepts as part of future practice, thinking, and life skills. Race, social class, and gender as issues related to schooling have received major attention from educators and social scientists over the last two decades.\n The local authorities in England gave a survey report   in November 2005.  This report is based on visits by Her Majesty.s Inspectors (HMIs) and additional inspectors to 12 LEAs and 50 schools in England between summer term 2003 to spring term 2005. This report illustrates good practice on race equality in education in a sample of schools and local education authorities (LEAs) surveyed between the summer of 2003 and the spring of 2005. The survey focused on schools and LEAs that were involved effectively in race equality in education. Four areas were examined by inspectors: improving standards and achievement amongst groups of pupils, with reference to the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 (RRAA); the incorporation of race equality concepts into the curriculum in schools; the handling and reporting of race-related incidents in schools; the work of schools and LEAs in improving links with local minority ethnic communities.\n The   (ATL) (ATL promotes and protects the interests of its members \u2013 teachers, lecturers, support staff and other education professionals) introduced a practical resource for the school workforce   in the UK educational system. The publication sets out to examine the racial, religious or cultural terminology regularly used in today's society, in an attempt to combat prejudice based on colour, ethnicity, religion or culture. \n Carol D. Lee described the rationale for a special theme issue, \"Reconceptualizing Race and Ethnicity in Educational Research.\" The rationale includes the historical and contemporary ways that cultural differences have been positioned in educational research and the need for more nuanced and complex analyses of ethnicity and race. \n A major task of South Africa's new government in 1994 was to promote racial equity in the state education system. This paper evaluates progress towards this goal using three distinct concepts: equal treatment, equal educational opportunity, and educational adequacy. The authors find that the country has succeeded in establishing racial equity defined as equal treatment, primarily through race-blind policies for allocating state funds for schools. Progress measured by the other two criteria, however, has been constrained by the legacy of apartheid, including poor facilities and lack of human capacity in schools serving black students, and by policies such as school fees. \n Education literature tends to treat race, social class, and gender as separate issues.  A review of a sample of education literature from four academic journals, spanning ten years, sought to determine how much these status groups were integrated. The study found little integration. The study then provided a research example on cooperative learning to illustrate how attention to only one status group oversimplifies the analysis of student behavior in school. From findings of studies integrating race and class, and race and gender, the study argues that attending only to race, in this example, oversimplifies behavior analysis and may help perpetuate gender and class biases. To determine to what extent race, social class, and gender are integrated in the education literature, the study examined a sample of literature published over a ten-year period and 30 articles focused primarily on race, or on school issues related directly to race, such as desegregation. \n The report is by the   Education Directorate with support from the Asia Society as a background report for the first   Global Cities Network Symposium, Hong Kong, May 10\u201312, 2012. Asia Society organized the Global Cities Education Network, a network of urban school systems in North America and Asia to focus on challenges and opportunities for improvement common to them, and to virtually all city education systems. This report presents the key recommendations of the OECD publication Equity and Quality in Education: Supporting Disadvantaged Students and Schools (2012a), which maps out policy levers that can help build high quality and equitable education systems, with a particular focus on North American and Asia-Pacific countries. \n The long-term social and economic consequences of having little education are more tangible now than ever before. Those without the skills to participate socially and economically in society generate higher costs of  ,  ,   and  . \n While both   and higher education have both been improved and expanded in the past 50 years, this has not translated to a more equal society in terms of academics. While the   has made great strides for women, other groups have not been as fortunate. Generally,   has not increased, while   has.  So, while more students are getting a basic education and even attending universities, a dramatic divide is present and many people are still being left behind.\n As increased immigration causes problems in educational equity for some countries, poor   in other countries is also a major issue. In countries where continued migration causes an issue, the ever-changing social structure of different races makes it difficult to propose a long-term solution to educational equity. On the other hand, many countries with consistent levels of diversity experience long-standing issues of integrating  . Challenges for minorities and migrants are often exacerbated as these groups statistically struggle more in terms of lower academic performance and lower  . \n The notion of equity in education is poorly defined and ambiguous. Definitions are often so broad as to be meaningless, and often conflict in meaning. For example; \"Educational equity means that each child receives what they need to develop to their full academic and social potential\",  \"Equity in education is when every student receives the resources needed to acquire the basic work skills of reading, writing, and simple arithmetic. It measures educational success in society by its outcome, not the resources poured into it\"  and \"Equity means offering individualized support to students that addresses possible barriers, like poverty or limited transportation\".  \n If equity is taken as non-banal, its usage most consistently refers to apportioning resources to students according to social and developmental need in order to alleviate the otherwise differential educational outcomes which occur as a consequence of such need. However, \nthe notion is not underpinned by valid scholarly research. For example, differential outcomes between groups and individuals often occur as a function of biology/psychology and not social background; appropriate 'equitable' resource apportionment would therefore appear to require a clear distinction between where differential performance is caused by social background and where it is caused by biological/psychological factors. The extensive literature on the subject of equity typically does make such a distinction. \n Very often, equity takes the form of simple   and  , particularly for students who are labelled as disadvantaged. While this might help students acquire a diploma, it does little to help them acquire skills needed for their careers. \n \n"},

A sonata may begin with an  , which is commonly slower than the remainder of the movement. After that, there is an exposition, whose purpose is to present the movement's main thematic material. This takes the form of one or two themes or theme groups, the second of which is commonly in a related key. The exposition may conclude with a short   and/or closing theme and may be repeated. This is followed by the development section, in which existing thematic material may be presented in new harmonic and textural contexts and/or entirely new material may be introduced. Next comes the recapitulation, where all themes or theme groups from the exposition are presented again but now in the tonic key. Sonatas may optionally end with a final large section called the  .\n The following shows the structure of sonata form. In the notation, a single prime (') means \"in the dominant\" and a double prime (\") means \"in remote keys\".\n Occasionally, sonata form includes an \"episodic development,\" which uses mostly new thematic material.  Two examples are the first movements of  's   and    .   The episodic development is often the kind of development that is used in sonata rondo form, to which we now turn.\n Sonata rondo form combines features of the five-part rondo and sonata form.

For this explanation, see  .\n  conjectured in his \"Mozart and His Piano Concertos\" that the sonata rondo form derives also in part from the dances   of  , among others, by structural elaboration, possibly an innovation of Mozart's. \n Sonata rondo form is almost exclusively used in the finales of multi-movement works.   It is considered a somewhat relaxed and discursive form.  Thus, it is unsuited to an opening movement (typically the musically tightest and most intellectually rigorous movement in a Classical work). It is, exceptionally, used in the opening Andante movement of Haydn's D-major piano sonata Hob. XVI:51.   Here are some movements written in sonata rondo form:\n"},

He was also apolitical, and took the Reichsmusikkammer post to advance copyright protections for composers, attempting as well to preserve performances of works by banned composers such as Mahler and  . Further, Strauss insisted on using a Jewish librettist,  , for his opera   which ultimately led to his firing from the Reichsmusikkammer and Bayreuth. His opera  , which premiered just before the outbreak of  , was a thinly veiled criticism of the Nazi Party that attempted to persuade Germans to abandon violence for peace. Thanks to his influence, his daughter-in-law was placed under protected house arrest during the war, but despite extensive efforts he was unable to save dozens of his in-laws from being killed in  . In 1948, a year before his death, he was cleared of any wrongdoing by a   tribunal in Munich.\n Strauss was born on 11 June 1864 in  , the son of Josephine (n\u00e9e Pschorr) and  , who was the principal   player at the Court Opera in Munich and a professor at the  .  His mother was the daughter of Georg Pschorr, a financially prosperous  .  \n Strauss began his musical studies at the age of four, studying piano with August Tombo who was the harpist in the Munich Court Orchestra.  Soon after, he began attending the rehearsals of the orchestra, and began getting lessons in music theory and orchestration from the ensemble's assistant conductor. He wrote his first composition at the age of six, and continued to write music almost until his death. In 1872, he started receiving violin instruction from  , the director of the Munich Court Orchestra and his father's cousin, and at 11 began five years of compositional study with Friedrich Wilhelm Meyer.  In 1882 he graduated from the Ludwigsgymnasium and afterwards attended only one year at the   in 1882\u20131883. \n In addition to his formal teachers, Strauss was profoundly influenced musically by his father who made instrumental music-making central to the Strauss home. The Strauss family was frequently joined in their home for music making, meals, and other activities by the orphaned composer and music theorist   who was viewed as an adopted member of the family.  Strauss's father taught his son the music of Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, and Schubert.  His father further assisted his son with his musical composition during the 1870s and into the early 1880s, providing advice, comments, and criticisms.  His father also provided support by showcasing his son's compositions in performance with the 'Wilde Gung'l', an amateur orchestra he conducted from 1875 to 1896. Many of his early symphonic compositions were written for this ensemble.  His compositions at this time were indebted to the style of   and  , true to his father's teachings. His father undoubtedly had a crucial influence on his son's developing taste, not least in Strauss's abiding love for the horn. His  , is representative of this period and is a staple of the modern horn repertoire. \n In 1874, Strauss heard his first   operas,   and  .  In 1878 he attended performances of   and   in Munich, and in 1879 he attended performances of the entire  ,  , and  .  The influence of Wagner's music on Strauss's style was to be profound, but at first his musically conservative father forbade him to study it. Indeed, in the Strauss household, the music of Richard Wagner was viewed with deep suspicion, and it was not until the age of 16 that Strauss was able to obtain a score of  .  In 1882 he went to the   to hear his father perform in the world premiere of Wagner's  ; after which surviving letters to his father and to Thuille detail his seemingly negative impression of Wagner and his music.  In later life, Strauss said that he deeply regretted the conservative hostility to Wagner's progressive works. \n In early 1882, in Vienna, Strauss gave the first performance of his  , playing a piano reduction of the orchestral part himself, with his teacher Benno Walter as soloist. The same year he entered  , where he studied philosophy and art history, but not music. He left a year later to go to Berlin, where he studied briefly before securing a post with the   as assistant conductor to  , who had been enormously impressed by the young composer's   for wind instruments, composed when he was only 16 years of age. Strauss learned the art of conducting by observing B\u00fclow in rehearsal. B\u00fclow was very fond of the young man, and Strauss considered him as his greatest conducting mentor, often crediting him as teaching him \"the art of interpretation\".  Notably, under B\u00fclow's baton he made his first major appearance as a concert pianist, performing Mozart's  , for which he composed his own  . \n In December 1885, B\u00fclow unexpectedly resigned from his post, and Strauss was left to lead the Meiningen Court Orchestra as interim principal conductor for the remainder of the artistic season through April 1886.  He notably helped prepare the orchestra for the world premiere performance of  's  , which Brahms himself conducted. He also conducted his   for Brahms, who advised Strauss: \"Your symphony contains too much playing about with themes. This piling up of many themes based on a triad, which differ from one another only in rhythm, has no value.\"  Brahms' music, like Wagner's, also left a tremendous impression upon Strauss, and he often referred to this time of his life as his 'Brahmsschw\u00e4rmerei' ('Brahms adoration') during which several his compositions clearly show Brahms' influence, including the  , Op. 13 (1883\u201384),   (1884) and   (1885\u201386).\" \n In 1885 Strauss met the composer   who was a violinist in the Meiningen orchestra and the husband of one of  's nieces. An avid champion of the ideals of Wagner and  , Ritter had a tremendous impact on the trajectory of Strauss's work as a composer from 1885 onward. Ritter convinced Strauss to abandon his more conservative style of composing and embrace the \"music of the future\" by modeling his compositional style on Wagner and Liszt.  He further influenced Strauss by engaging him in studies and conversations on the writings of  , Wagner, and Friedrich von Hausegger. All of this together gave a new aesthetic anchor to Strauss which first became evident in his embrace of the   genre. \n After leaving his post in Meiningen in 1886, Strauss spent several weeks traveling throughout Italy before assuming a new post as third conductor at the   (then known as the Munich Hofoper). While traveling he wrote down descriptions of the various sites he was seeing along with tonal impressions that went with those descriptions. These he communicated in a letter to his mother, and they ultimately were used as the beginning of his first tone poem,   (1886).  Shortly after Strauss assumed his opera conducting duties in Munich, Ritter himself moved to the city in September 1886. For the next three years the two men would meet regularly, often joined by Thuille and  , to discuss music, particularly Wagner and Liszt, and discuss poetry, literature, and philosophy. \n Strauss's tenure at the Bavarian State Opera was not a happy one. With the death of   in June 1886, the opera house was not as well financially supported by his successor   which meant that much of the more ambitious and expensive repertoire that he wanted to stage, such as Wagner's operas, were unfeasible. The opera assignments he was given, works by Boieldieu, Auber and Donizetti, bored him, and to make matters worse Hermann Levi, the senior conductor at the house, was often ill and Strauss was required to step in at the last minute to conduct performance for operas which he had never rehearsed. This caused problems for him, the singers, and the orchestra. During this time, Strauss did find much more enjoyable conducting work outside Munich in Berlin, Dresden, and Leipzig. In the latter city he met and befriended the composer   in the autumn of 1887. Also happily, Strauss met his future wife, soprano  , in 1887. De Ahna was then a voice student at the Munich Musikschule (now the  ), but soon switched to private lessons with Strauss who became her principal teacher. \n In May 1889 Strauss left his post with the Bavarian State Opera after being appointed   to   in Weimar, beginning in the autumn of 1889. During the summer of 1889 he served as the assistant conductor of the   during which time he befriended   who became a longterm close friend.  Pauline De Ahna went with Strauss to Weimar and he later married her on 10 September 1894. She was famous for being irascible, garrulous, eccentric and outspoken, but to all appearances the marriage was essentially happy, and she was a great source of inspiration to him. Throughout his life, from his earliest songs to the final   of 1948, he preferred the   to all others, and all his operas contain important soprano roles. In Weimar she created the role of Freihild in Strauss's first opera,  , in 1894. The opera was received with mixed reviews in Weimar, but its later production in Munich was met with scorn and was Strauss's first major failure. \n In spite of the failure of his first opera, Strauss's tenure in Weimar brought about several important successes for his career. His tone poem   premiered in Weimar on 11 November 1889 to tremendous critical response, and the work quickly brought him international fame and success. This was followed by another lauded achievement, the premiere of his tone poem   in 1890. Both of these works, along with the earlier  , became internationally known and established him as a leading modernist composer.  He also had much success as a conductor in Weimar, particularly with the symphonic poems of Liszt and an uncut production of   in 1892. \n In the summer of 1894 Strauss made his conducting debut at the Bayreuth Festival, conducting Wagner's   with Pauline singing Elisabeth. Just prior to their marriage the following September, Strauss left his post in Weimar when he was appointed Kapellmeister, or first conductor, of the Bavarian State Opera where he became responsible for the operas of Wagner. While working in Munich for the next four years he had his largest creative period of tone poem composition, producing   (1895),   (1896),   (1897), and   (1898).  He also served as principal conductor of the   in 1894\u20131895. In 1897, the Strausses' only child, their son Franz, was born.  In 1906, Strauss purchased a block of land at   and had a villa ( ) built there with the down payments from the publisher   for his opera  ,  residing there until his death. \n Strauss left the Bavarian State Opera in 1898 when he became principal conductor of the   at the   in the fall of 1898; a position he remained in for 15 years. By this time in his career, he was in constant demand as a guest conductor internationally and enjoyed celebrity status as a conductor; particularly in the works of  ,  , and   in addition to his own compositions.  He became president of the   in 1901, and that same year became leader of the  .  He also served as editor of the book series  . He used all of these posts to champion contemporary German composers like  . His own compositions were becoming increasingly popular, and the first major orchestra to perform an entire concert of only his music was the   in 1901.  In 1903 Strauss Festivals dedicated to his music were established in London and Heidelberg. At the latter festival his cantata   was given its world premiere. \n In 1904 Strauss embarked on his first North American tour, with stops in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati, New York City, and Pittsburgh. At   he conducted the world premiere of his   on 21 March 1904 with the  .  He also conducted several other works in collaboration with composer   and his orchestra that year at Carnegie Hall, and also performed a concert of lieder with his wife.  During this trip he was working intensively on composing his third opera,  , based on  's 1891 play  . The work, which premiered in Dresden in 1905, became Strauss's greatest triumph in his career up to that point, and opera houses all over the world quickly began programing the opera. \n After  , Strauss had a string of critically successful operas which he created with the librettist and poet  . These operas included   (1909),   (1911),   (1912, rev. 1916),   (1919),   (1928), and   (1933).  While all of these works remain part of the opera repertoire, his opera   is generally considered his finest achievement.  During this time he continued to work internationally as a celebrity conductor, and from 1919 to 1924 he was principal conductor of the  .  In 1920 he co-founded the   with   and the set designer Alfred Rolle. In 1924 Strauss's opera   premiered at the   with both the music and libretto by Strauss. For this opera, Strauss wanted to move away from post-Wagnerian metaphysics which had been the philosophical framework of Hofmannsthal's libretti, and instead embrace a modern domestic comedy to Hofmannsthal's chagrin.  The work proved to be a success. \n At the outbreak of   Strauss was invited to sign the   supporting the German role in the conflict. Several colleagues, including  , signed, but Strauss refused, and his response was recorded with approval by the French critic   in his diary for October 1914: \"Declarations about war and politics are not fitting for an artist, who must give his attention to his creations and his works.\" \n In 1924 Strauss's son Franz married Alice von Grab-Hermannsw\u00f6rth, daughter of a Jewish industrialist, in a Roman Catholic ceremony.  Franz and Alice had two sons, Richard and Christian. \n In March 1933, when Strauss was 68,   and the    . Strauss never joined the Nazi Party, and studiously avoided  . For reasons of expediency, however, he was initially drawn into cooperating with the early Nazi regime in the hope that Hitler\u2014an ardent Wagnerian and music lover who had admired Strauss's work since viewing   in 1907\u2014would promote German art and culture. Strauss's need to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law and Jewish grandchildren also motivated his behavior,  in addition to his determination to preserve and conduct the music of banned composers such as   and  .\n In 1933, Strauss wrote in his private notebook:\n I consider the  \u2013Goebbels Jew-baiting as a disgrace to German honour, as evidence of incompetence\u2014the basest weapon of untalented, lazy mediocrity against a higher intelligence and greater talent. Meanwhile, far from being an admirer of Strauss's work,   maintained expedient cordiality with Strauss only for a period. Goebbels wrote in his diary:\n Unfortunately we still need him, but one day we shall have our own music and then we shall have no further need of this decadent neurotic. Nevertheless, because of Strauss's international eminence, in November 1933 he was appointed to the post of president of the newly founded  , the Reich Music Chamber. Strauss, who had lived through numerous political regimes and had no interest in politics, decided to accept the position but to remain apolitical, a decision which would eventually become untenable. He wrote to his family, \"I made music under  , and under  . I'll survive under this one as well.\"  In 1935 he wrote in his journal:\n In November 1933, the minister Goebbels nominated me president of the   without obtaining my prior agreement. I was not consulted. I accepted this honorary office because I hoped that I would be able to do some good and prevent worse misfortunes, if from now onwards German musical life were going to be, as it was said, \"reorganized\" by amateurs and ignorant place-seekers. Strauss privately scorned Goebbels and called him \"a pipsqueak\".  However, in 1933 he dedicated an orchestral song, \" \" (\"The Little Brook\"), to Goebbels, to gain his cooperation in extending German music copyright laws from 30 years to 50 years.  Also in 1933, he replaced   as director of the Bayreuth Festival after Toscanini had resigned in protest against the Nazi regime. \n Strauss attempted to ignore Nazi bans on performances of works by Debussy, Mahler, and Mendelssohn. He also continued to work on a comic opera,  , with his Jewish friend and librettist  . When the opera was premiered in Dresden in 1935, Strauss insisted that Zweig's name appear on the theatrical billing, much to the ire of the Nazi regime. Hitler and Goebbels avoided attending the opera, and it was halted after three performances and subsequently banned by the  . \n On 17 June 1935, Strauss wrote a letter to Stefan Zweig, in which he stated:\n Do you believe I am ever, in any of my actions, guided by the thought that I am 'German'? Do you suppose Mozart was consciously 'Aryan' when he composed? I recognise only two types of people: those who have talent and those who have none. This letter to Zweig was intercepted by the   and sent to Hitler. Strauss was subsequently   from his post as   president in 1935. The   nevertheless used Strauss's  , which he had composed in 1934. Strauss's seeming relationship with the Nazis in the 1930s attracted criticism from some noted musicians, including Toscanini, who in 1933 had said, \"To Strauss the composer I take off my hat; to Strauss the man I put it back on again\", when Strauss had accepted the presidency of the  .  Much of Strauss's motivation in his conduct during the Third Reich was, however, to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice and his Jewish grandchildren from persecution. Both of his grandsons were bullied at school, but Strauss used his considerable influence to prevent the boys or their mother being sent to  . \n Frustrated that he could no longer work with Zweig as his librettist, Strauss turned to  , a Viennese theatre historian, at Gregor's request. The first opera they worked on together was  , but it ultimately became the second of their operas to be premiered. Their first work to be staged was in 1938, when the entire nation was preparing for war, they presented   ( ), a one-act opera set in a besieged fortress during the  . The work is essentially a hymn to peace and a thinly veiled criticism of the Third Reich. With its contrasts between freedom and enslavement, war and peace, light and dark, this work has a close affinity with  's  . Productions of the opera ceased shortly after the outbreak of war in 1939. The two men collaborated on two more operas which proved to be Strauss's last:   (1940) and   (1942). \n When his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice was placed under house arrest in   in 1938, Strauss used his connections in Berlin, including opera-house General Intendant  , to secure her safety. He drove to the   to argue, albeit unsuccessfully, for the release of Alice's grandmother, Paula Neumann. In the end, Neumann and 25 other relatives were murdered in the camps.  While Alice's mother, Marie von Grab, was safe in Lucerne, Switzerland, Strauss also wrote several letters to the   pleading for the release of her children who were also held in camps; his letters were ignored. \n In 1942, Strauss moved with his family back to Vienna, where Alice and her children could be protected by  , the   of Vienna. However, Strauss was unable to protect his Jewish relatives completely; in early 1944, while Strauss was away, Alice and her son Franz were abducted by the Gestapo and imprisoned for two nights. Strauss's personal intervention at this point saved them, and he was able to take them back to Garmisch, where the two remained under house arrest until the end of the war. \n Strauss completed the composition of  , a work for 23 solo strings, in 1945. The title and inspiration for the work comes from a profoundly self-examining poem by  , which Strauss had considered setting as a choral work.  Generally regarded as one of the masterpieces of the string repertoire,   contains Strauss's most sustained outpouring of tragic emotion. Conceived and written during the blackest days of World War II, the piece expresses Strauss's mourning of, among other things, the destruction of German culture\u2014including the bombing of every great opera house in the nation. At the end of the war, Strauss wrote in his private diary:\n The most terrible period of human history is at an end, the twelve year reign of bestiality, ignorance and anti-culture under the greatest criminals, during which Germany's 2000 years of cultural evolution met its doom. In April 1945, Strauss was apprehended by American soldiers at his Garmisch estate. As he descended the staircase, he announced to Lieutenant Milton Weiss of the U.S. Army, \"I am Richard Strauss, the composer of   and  .\" Lt. Weiss, who was also a musician, nodded in recognition. An \"Off Limits\" sign was subsequently placed on the lawn to protect Strauss.  The American oboist  , who knew Strauss's orchestral writing for oboe thoroughly, was in the army unit, and asked Strauss to compose an oboe concerto. Initially dismissive of the idea, Strauss completed this late work, his  , before the end of the year. \n The metaphor \" \" has been used by journalists, biographers, and music critics, notably    in 1964  to describe Strauss's late creative upsurge from 1942 to the end of his life. The events of World War II seemed to bring the composer \u2013 who had grown old, tired, and a little jaded \u2013 into focus.  The major works of the last years of Strauss's life, written in his late 70s and 80s, include, among others, his  ,  , his  , his  , and his  . \n Like those of most Germans, Strauss's bank accounts were frozen, and many of his assets seized by American forces. Now elderly and with very few resources left, Strauss and his wife left Germany for Switzerland in October 1945 where they settled a hotel outside Zurich, and later at the Montreux Palace hotel in Montreux. There they met the Swiss music critic  , who became Strauss's biographer. Short of money, in 1947 Strauss embarked on his last international tour, a three-week trip to London, in which he conducted several of his tone poems and excerpts of his operas, and was present during a complete staging of   by the  . The trip was a critical success and provided him and his wife with some much-needed money. \n From May to September 1948, just before his death, Strauss composed the  , which deal with the subject of dying. The last one, \"Im Abendrot\" (At Sunset), ends with the line \"Is this perhaps death?\" The question is not answered in words, but instead Strauss quotes the \"transfiguration theme\" from his earlier tone poem   \u2014 meant to symbolize the transfiguration and fulfilment of the soul after death. In June 1948, he was cleared of any wrong-doing by a   tribunal in Munich.  That same month he orchestrated  , a song that he had originally composed in 1894. \n In December 1948, Strauss was hospitalized for several weeks after undergoing bladder surgery.  His health rapidly deteriorated after that, and he conducted his last performance, the end of Act 2 of   at the   in Munich, during celebrations of his 85th birthday on 10 June 1949. On 15 August, he suffered a heart attack and he quietly died of kidney failure in his sleep shortly after 2 PM on 8 September 1949, in  ,  .  From his death-bed, typical of his enduring sense of humour, he commented to his daughter-in-law Alice, \"dying is just as I composed it in  \".   , who had arranged Strauss's 85th birthday celebration, also directed an orchestra during Strauss's burial.  The conductor later described how, during the singing of the famous trio from  , \"each singer broke down in tears and dropped out of the ensemble, but they recovered themselves and we all ended together\".  Strauss's wife, Pauline de Ahna, died eight months later on 13 May 1950 at the age of 88. \n Strauss's late works (as an octogenarian composer) were modelled on \"the divine   at the end of a life full of thankfulness\".  Strauss himself declared in 1947 with characteristic self-deprecation: \"I may not be a first-rate composer, but I am a first-class second-rate composer.\" The Canadian pianist   described Strauss in 1962 as \"the greatest musical figure who has lived in this century\". \n Some of Strauss's first compositions were solo instrumental and chamber works. These pieces include early compositions for piano solo in a conservative harmonic style, many of which are lost: two piano trios (1877 and 1878), a string quartet (1881), a   (1882), a   (1883), a   (1885), a   (1888), as well as a serenade (1882) and a longer suite (1884), both scored for double wind quintet plus two additional horns and contrabassoon.\n After 1890, Strauss composed very infrequently for chamber groups, his energies being almost completely absorbed with large-scale orchestral works and operas. Four of his chamber pieces are actually arrangements of portions of his operas, including the   for solo violin and the String Sextet, which is the overture to his final opera  . His last independent chamber work, an Allegretto in E major for violin and piano, dates from 1948.\n He also composed two large-scale works for wind ensemble during this period: Sonatina No. 1 \"From an Invalid's Workshop\" (1943) and Sonatina No. 2 \"Happy Workshop\" (1946)\u2014both scored for double wind quintet plus two additional horns, a third clarinet in C, bassett horn, bass clarinet, and contrabassoon.\n Strauss wrote two early symphonies:   (1880) and   (1884). However, Strauss's style began to truly develop and change when, in 1885, he met  , a noted composer and violinist, and the husband of one of Richard Wagner's nieces. It was Ritter who persuaded Strauss to abandon the conservative style of his youth and begin writing  . He also introduced Strauss to the essays of Wagner and the writings of  . Strauss went on to conduct one of Ritter's operas, and at Strauss's request Ritter later wrote a poem describing the events depicted in Strauss's tone poem  .\nThe new influences from Ritter resulted in what is widely regarded  as Strauss's first piece to show his mature personality, the tone poem   (1888), which displays a new kind of virtuosity in its bravura orchestral manner. Strauss went on to write a series of increasingly ambitious tone poems:   (1889),   (1895),   (1896),   (1897),   (1898),   (1903) and   (1911\u20131915). One commentator has observed of these works that \"no orchestra could exist without his tone poems, written to celebrate the glories of the post-Wagnerian symphony orchestra.\" \n  notes a shift in Strauss's technique in the tone poems, occurring between 1892 and 1893. It was after this point that Strauss rejected the philosophy of Schopenhauer and began more forcefully critiquing the institution of the symphony and the symphonic poem, thereby differentiating the second cycle of tone poems from the first.\n Strauss's output of works for solo instrument or instruments with orchestra was fairly extensive. The most famous include two concertos for horn, which are still part of the standard repertoire of most horn soloists\u2014  (1883) and   (1942); the   (1883); a   (1882); the   (1885, revised 1889); the tone poem   for cello, viola and orchestra (1897); the well-known late   (1945); and the   with string orchestra, which was one of his last works (1948).\n Around the end of the 19th century, Strauss turned his attention to opera. His first two attempts in the genre,   (1894) and   (1901), were controversial works;   was the first significant critical failure of Strauss's career, and   was considered obscene by some critics. \n In 1905, Strauss produced  , a somewhat   modernist opera based on the   by  , which produced a passionate reaction from audiences. The premiere was a major success, with the artists taking more than 38 curtain calls.  Many later performances of the opera were also successful, not only with the general public but also with Strauss's peers:   said that   was \"stupendous\";    described it as \"a live volcano, a subterranean fire\".  Strauss reputedly financed his house in   completely from the revenues generated by the opera.  As with the later  ,   features an extremely taxing lead soprano role. Strauss often remarked that he preferred writing for the female voice, which is apparent in these two sister operas\u2014the male parts are almost entirely smaller roles, included only to supplement the soprano's performance.\n Strauss's next opera was   (1909), which took his use of dissonance even further, in particular with the  .   was also the first opera in which Strauss collaborated with the poet   as his librettist. The two subsequently worked together on numerous occasions. For his later works with Hofmannsthal, Strauss moderated his harmonic language: he used a more lush, melodic late-Romantic style based on Wagnerian chromatic harmonies that he had used in his tone poems, with much less dissonance, and exhibiting immense virtuosity in orchestral writing and tone color. This resulted in operas such as   (1911) having great public success. Strauss continued to produce operas at regular intervals until 1942. With Hofmannsthal he created   (1912),   (1919),   (1928), and   (1933). For   (1924) Strauss provided his own libretto.   (1935) was composed with   as librettist;   (1935\u201336) and   (1937) both had a libretto by   and Stefan Zweig; and   (1940) was with Joseph Gregor. Strauss's final opera,   (1942), had a libretto by  , although the genesis for it came from Stefan Zweig and Joseph Gregor.\n Strauss was a prolific composer of  . He often composed them with the voice of his wife in mind. His lieder were written for voice and piano, and he orchestrated several of them after the fact. In 1894\u20131895, around the age of 30, he published several well-known songs including \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", and \" \". In 1918, after a long hiatus devoted to opera, he wrote  , also called  . He completed his works in the genre in 1948 with   for soprano and orchestra. He reportedly composed these with   in mind and she gave the first performance, which was recorded. Strauss's songs have always been popular with audiences and performers, and are generally considered by musicologists\u2014along with many of his other compositions\u2014to be masterpieces.\n TIME magazine suggested in 1927 that he wrote music to test how much \"cacophony, dissonance, exaggeration, and clowning\" his audiences would applaud. Early in Strauss' career, eminent musicologist Hugo Riemann reflected \"His last works only too clearly reveal his determination to make a sensation at all costs\". \n Until the 1980s, Strauss was regarded by some post-modern musicologists as a conservative, backward-looking composer, but re-examination of and new research on the composer has re-evaluated his place as that of a modernist,  albeit one who still utilized and sometimes revered tonality and lush orchestration.  Strauss is noted for his pioneering subtleties of orchestration, combined with an advanced harmonic style; when he first played Strauss at a university production of  , the conductor   \"was flabbergasted. I had no idea music could do the things he was doing with   and melody.\" \n Strauss's music had a considerable influence on composers at the start of the 20th century.   heard   in 1902, and later said that the work \"contained the seeds for a new life\"; a Straussian influence is clearly present in his works of that period, including his  ,  , and  .    was also greatly influenced by Strauss, reflected in such pieces as his   and his first and   symphonies,  and his opera   which was modeled after  . English composers were also influenced by Strauss, from   in his concert overture   and other works  to   in his opera writing. Many contemporary composers recognise a debt to Strauss, including   and  . \n Strauss's musical style played a major role in the development of film music in the middle of the 20th century. The style of his musical depictions of character (Don Juan, Till Eulenspiegel, the Hero) and emotions found their way into the lexicon of film music. Film music historian Timothy Schuerer wrote, \"The elements of post (late) romantic music that had greatest impact on scoring are its lush sound, expanded harmonic language, chromaticism, use of program music and use of  . Hollywood composers found the post-romantic idiom compatible with their efforts in scoring film\".    and   came from the same musical world as Strauss and were quite naturally drawn to write in his style. As film historian Roy Prendergast wrote, \"When confronted with the kind of dramatic problem films presented to them, Steiner, Korngold and   ... looked to Wagner,  , Verdi and Strauss for the answers to dramatic film scoring.\"  Later, the opening to   became one of the best-known pieces of film music when   used it in his 1968 movie  . The film music of   has continued the Strauss influence, in scores for mainstream hits such as   and  . \n Strauss has always been popular with audiences in the concert hall and continues to be so. He has consistently been in the top 10 composers most performed by symphony orchestras in the US and Canada over the period 2002\u20132010.  He is also in the top 5 of 20th-century composers (born after 1860) in terms of the number of currently available recordings of his works. \n Strauss, as conductor, made a large number of recordings, both of his own music as well as music by German and Austrian composers. His 1929 performances of   and   with the   have long been considered the best of his early electrical recordings. In the first complete performance of his  , made in 1941 and later released by  , Strauss used the full complement of percussion instruments required in this work.\n  has also released Strauss's recordings of overtures by  ,  ,  , and  . The preference for German and Austrian composers in Germany in the 1920s through the 1940s was typical of the German nationalism that existed after  . Strauss clearly capitalized on national pride for the great German-speaking composers.\n There were many other recordings, including some taken from radio broadcasts and concerts during the 1930s and early 1940s. The sheer volume of recorded performances would undoubtedly yield some definitive performances from a very capable and rather forward-looking conductor.\n In 1944, Strauss celebrated his 80th birthday and conducted the   in recordings of his own major orchestral works, as well as his seldom-heard   ( ) ballet music. Some find more feeling in these performances than in Strauss's earlier recordings, which were recorded on the   tape recording equipment.   later issued the recordings on LPs. Some of these recordings have been reissued on CD by Preiser. The last recording made by Strauss was on 19 October 1947 live at the   in London, where he conducted the   in his   for piano and orchestra (Alfred Blumen piano),   and  . \n Strauss also made live-recording   music rolls for the Hupfeld system and in 1906 ten recordings for the     all of which survive today. Strauss was also the composer of the music on the first CD to be commercially released:  's 1983 release of their 1980 recording of   conducting the  .\n  has said that Strauss the conductor was \"a complete master of his trade\".  Music critic   writes that, while Strauss was a very fine conductor, he often put scant effort into his recordings.  Schonberg focused primarily on Strauss's recordings of  's   and  's  , as well as noting that Strauss played a breakneck version of Beethoven's   in about 45 minutes. Concerning Beethoven's 7th Symphony, Schonberg wrote, \"There is almost never a   or a change in expression or nuance. The slow movement is almost as fast as the following  ; and the last movement, with a big cut in it, is finished in 4 minutes, 25 seconds. (It should run between 7 and 8 minutes.)\"  He also complained that the Mozart symphony had \"no force, no charm, no inflection, with a metronomic rigidity\".\n 's 1994 review for   says the performances of the Beethoven 5th and 7th symphonies, as well as Mozart's last three symphonies, are actually quite good, even if they are sometimes unconventional. Gutmann wrote:\n It is true, as the critics suggest, that the readings forego overt emotion, but what emerges instead is a solid sense of structure, letting the music speak convincingly for itself. It is also true that Strauss's tempos are generally swift, but this, too, contributes to the structural cohesion and in any event is fully in keeping with our modern outlook in which speed is a virtue and attention spans are defined more by MTV clips and news sound bites than by evenings at the opera and thousand page novels.

The accelerated failure time model describes a situation where the biological or mechanical life history of an event is accelerated (or decelerated).\n Survival models can be viewed as consisting of two parts: the underlying baseline  , often denoted  , describing how the risk of event per time unit changes over time at   levels of covariates; and the effect parameters, describing how the hazard varies in response to explanatory covariates. A typical medical example would include covariates such as treatment assignment, as well as patient characteristics such as age at start of study, gender, and the presence of other diseases at start of study, in order to reduce variability and/or control for confounding.\n The   states that covariates are multiplicatively related to the hazard. In the simplest case of stationary coefficients, for example, a treatment with a drug may, say, halve a subject's hazard at any given time  , while the baseline hazard may vary. Note however, that this does not double the lifetime of the subject; the precise effect of the covariates on the lifetime depends on the type of  . The   is not restricted to binary predictors; in the case of a continuous covariate  , it is typically assumed that the hazard responds exponentially; each unit increase in   results in proportional scaling of the hazard.\n  observed that if the proportional hazards assumption holds (or, is assumed to hold) then it is possible to estimate the effect parameter(s), denoted   below, without any consideration of the full hazard function.  This approach to survival data is called application of the  ,  sometimes abbreviated to   or to  .  However, Cox also noted that biological interpretation of the proportional hazards assumption can be quite tricky. \n Let   be the realized values of the   covariates for subject  .  The hazard function for the Cox proportional hazards model has the form\n To start, suppose we only have a single covariate,  , and therefore a single coefficient,  . Consider the effect of increasing   by 1:\n We can see that increasing a covariate by 1 scales the original hazard by the constant  . Rearranging things slightly, we see that:\n The right-hand-side is constant over time (no term has a   in it). This relationship,  , is called a  .\n More generally, consider two subjects,   and  , with covariates   and   respectively. Consider the ratio of their hazards:\n The right-hand-side isn't dependent on time, as the only time-dependent factor,  , was cancelled out. Thus the ratio of hazards of two subjects is a constant, i.e. the hazards are proportional.\n Often there is an intercept term (also called a constant term or bias term) used in regression models. The Cox model lacks one because the baseline hazard,  , takes the place of it. Let's see what would happen if we did include an intercept term anyways, denoted  :\n The Cox  , shown below, is obtained by using Breslow's estimate of the baseline hazard function, plugging it into the full likelihood and then observing that the result is a product of two factors. The first factor is the partial likelihood shown below, in which the baseline hazard has \"canceled out\". The second factor is free of the regression coefficients and depends on the data only through the  . The effect of covariates estimated by any proportional hazards model can thus be reported as  .\n The likelihood of the event to be observed occurring for subject   at time   can be written as:\n Treating the subjects as if they were statistically independent of each other, the joint probability of all realized events  is the following partial likelihood, where the occurrence of the event is indicated by  \u00a0=\u00a01:\n The corresponding log partial likelihood is\n This function can be maximized over   to produce maximum partial likelihood estimates of the model parameters.\n The partial   is\n and the   of the partial log likelihood is\n Using this score function and Hessian matrix, the partial likelihood can be maximized using the   algorithm. The inverse of the Hessian matrix, evaluated at the estimate of  , can be used as an approximate variance-covariance matrix for the estimate, and used to produce approximate   for the regression coefficients.\n Several approaches have been proposed to handle situations in which there are ties in the time data.   describes the approach in which the procedure described above is used unmodified, even when ties are present. An alternative approach that is considered to give better results is  .  Let   denote the unique times, let   denote the set of indices   such that  \u00a0=\u00a0  and  \u00a0=\u00a01, and let  \u00a0=\u00a0| |.  Efron's approach maximizes the following partial likelihood.\n The corresponding log partial likelihood is\n Note that when   is empty (all observations with time   are censored), the summands in these expressions are treated as zero.\n Below are some worked examples of the Cox model in practice.\n Suppose the endpoint we are interested in is patient survival during a 5-year observation period after a surgery. Patients can die within the 5-year period, and we record when they died, or patients can live past 5 years, and we only record that they lived past 5 years. The surgery was performed at one of two hospitals,   or  , and we would like to know if the hospital location is associated with 5-year survival. Specifically, we would like to know the   increase (or decrease) in hazard from a surgery performed at hospital A compared to hospital B. Provided is some (fake) data, where each row represents a patient:   is how long the patient was observed for before death or 5 years (measured in months), and   denotes if the patient died in the 5-year period. We have encoded the hospital as a binary variable denoted  : 1 if from hospital  , 0 from hospital  .\n Our single-covariate Cox proportional model looks like the following, with   representing the hospital's effect, and   indexing each patient:\n Using statistical software, we can estimate   to be 2.12. The hazard ratio is the   of this value,  . To see why, consider the ratio of hazards, specifically:\n Thus, the hazard ratio of hospital A to hospital B is  . Putting aside statistical significance for a moment, we can make a statement saying that patients in hospital A are associated with a 8.3x higher risk of death occurring in any short period of time compared to hospital B.\n There are important caveats to mention about the interpretation:\n To demonstrate a less traditional use case of survival analysis, the next example will be an economics question: what is the relationship between a company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) on their first IPO anniversary and their future survival? More specifically, if we consider a company's \"birth event\" to be their first IPO anniversary, and any bankruptcy, sale, going private, etc. as a \"death\" event the company, we'd like to know the influence of the companies' P/E ratio at their \"birth\" (first IPO anniversary) on their survival.\n Provided is a (fake) dataset with survival data from 12 companies:   represents the number of days between first IPO anniversary and death (or an end date of 2022-01-01, if did not die).   represents if the company died before 2022-01-01 or not. P/E represents the company's price-to-earnings ratio at its 1st IPO anniversary.\n Unlike the previous example where there was a binary variable, this dataset has a continuous variable, P/E; however, the model looks similar:\n Since the baseline hazard,  , was not estimated, the entire hazard is not able to be calculated. However, consider the ratio of the companies   and  s hazards:\n All terms on the right are known, so calculating the ratio of hazards between companies is possible. Since there is no time-dependent term on the right (all terms are constant), the hazards are   to each other. For example, the hazard ratio of company 5 to company 2 is  . This means that, within the interval of study, company 5's risk of \"death\" is 0.33 \u2248 1/3 as large as company 2's risk of death.\n There are important caveats to mention about the interpretation:\n Extensions to time dependent variables, time dependent strata, and multiple events per subject, can be incorporated by the counting process formulation of Andersen and Gill.  One example of the use of hazard models with time-varying regressors is estimating the effect of unemployment insurance on unemployment spells. \n In addition to allowing   (i.e., predictors), the Cox model may be generalized to time-varying coefficients as well. That is, the proportional effect of a treatment may vary with time; e.g. a drug may be very effective if administered within one month of  , and become less effective as time goes on. The hypothesis of no change with time (stationarity) of the coefficient may then be tested. Details and software ( ) are available in Martinussen and Scheike (2006). \n In this context, it could also be mentioned that it is theoretically possible to specify the effect of covariates by using additive hazards,  i.e. specifying\n The Cox model may be specialized if a reason exists to assume that the baseline hazard follows a particular form. In this case, the baseline hazard   is replaced by a given function. For example, assuming the hazard function to be the   gives the  .\n Incidentally, using the Weibull baseline hazard is the only circumstance under which the model satisfies both the proportional hazards, and   models.\n The generic term   can be used to describe proportional hazards models in which the hazard function is specified.  The Cox proportional hazards model is sometimes called a    by contrast.\n Some authors use the term   even when specifying the underlying hazard function,  to acknowledge the debt of the entire field to David Cox.\n The term   (omitting  ) is sometimes used to describe the extension of the Cox model to include time-dependent factors.  However, this usage is potentially ambiguous since the Cox proportional hazards model can itself be described as a regression model.\n There is a relationship between proportional hazards models and   models which is sometimes used to fit approximate proportional hazards models in software for Poisson regression.  The usual reason for doing this is that calculation is much quicker.  This was more important in the days of slower computers but can still be useful for particularly large data sets or complex problems.  Laird and Olivier (1981)  provide the mathematical details.  They note, \"we do not assume [the Poisson model] is true, but simply use it as a device for deriving the likelihood.\"  McCullagh and Nelder's  book on generalized linear models has a chapter on converting proportional hazards models to  .\n In high-dimension, when number of covariates p is large compared to the sample size n, the   is one of the classical model-selection strategies. Tibshirani (1997) has proposed a Lasso procedure for the proportional hazard regression parameter.  The Lasso estimator of the regression parameter \u03b2 is defined as the minimizer of the opposite of the Cox partial log-likelihood under an   type constraint.\n There has been theoretical progress on this topic recently. \n"},

It is completely surrounded by forest, most of which is state owned.\n The Frankish style homesteads are in a widespread arrangement with exposed timber-framed construction. The pointed steeple of the St. George church towers above the village. Two small streams, one of which is dammed north at the village pond, merge southwest of the church to form the Ried stream on which a mill is located. Further east there is a new residential development located on the Ottersee (Otter lake) which was formerly a vacation cottage area. \n Reichmannshausen was developed from a clearing in the land of the neighboring Wettringen royal manor, to which it belonged until 1804.\n The earliest known reference to the village notes a \"Richalmeshusen\" (houses of Richalm) and comes from a 1290 deed, which mentions that it was the seat of the Mariaburghausen cloister.\n By 1522, there were already 34 houses around the original Richalm farmstead. The village passed hands several more times:  the   owned Reichmannshausen until the family became extinct in 1583.

Protestant soldiers tracked him down and he was taken to the nearby Mainberg castle. The soldiers tried to force him to renounce his Catholic faith. Wagner refused; when asked if he was still Catholic, he replied, \"I live, I suffer, and I die a papal Catholic.\" After five days of torture, he died on 9 December 1631. His body was thrown into the nearby Main River. He was beatified by the Catholic church on March 24, 1974. \n Between the World Wars, Reichmannshausen was known as a \u201cforest air health resort\u201d due to its remoteness, tranquility, and dense forest. The village had a regular motor coach service to Schweinfurt. \n In its current form the English translation is \"Rich Man's City\"; however, the name has   origins. An early settler named Richalm most likely gave name to the village \"Richalmeshusen\" or \u201chouses of Richalm\" as it appears in a 1290 deed. There was a lot of variation in the spelling of the village over the years. For example, a 1771 map shows the name \"Reichenmanshausen\" and a 1778 map shows the spelling \"Reichinmannshausen\".\n Despite its remoteness, Reichmannshausen is well situated in the local transportation network.

It quickly spread, however, to include the arrest and imprisonment of popular Chinese Christian leaders, particularly  . \n The religious policy adopted by the   reflected a centuries-old tradition of attempting to regulate religion and a particular distrust of Christianity as an imported religion with ties to Western powers.  Historically,   viewed the Christian faith as a foreign religion and sought to contain its spread. In 1812 the   decreed that leaders among \"Europeans\" and \"Tartars and Chinese\" \"deputed by Europeans\" who engaged in missionary work should be executed or imprisoned and their followers should be exiled.  In the mid-19th century, a few missionaries and their overseas supporters endorsed using force to open up China. Some took part in political endeavors, including acting as translators for treaty negotiations arising from the   and other imperialist aggressions by Western powers. In these negotiations the missionaries/translators extracted from the government guarantees of protection of missionaries and their activities.  As a result, the missionary endeavor became inextricably entwined in public perceptions with   and the  .  Missionaries were also accused of engaging promoting Western values and customs, a form of  .  Resentment against Western domination boiled over in the   in 1899\u20131901, during which many missionaries and Chinese Christians were killed. In the 1920s, following the establishment of the   in 1911, disappointment over the ceding of   to the Japanese in   following  ,  and the ensuing anti-Western nationalistic  ,  an   revived accusations of missionary participation in imperialism. \n The immediate precipitating factor of the Denunciation Movement was the entry of China into the   on October 25, 1950. Since some missionaries had favored   and the   in the   that brought the   to power, missionaries in general were viewed as potential collaborators with the Western powers in the Korean conflict. In March 1951 the   decreed a priority of eliminating imperialist influences over religious groups in China.\n The   led by   called for a conference in   in April 1951 to discuss \"Handling of Christian Organizations Receiving Subsidies from the United States of America.\" That conference had three key outcomes:\n The Denunciation Movement drew on resentments dating back to the Opium Wars in targeting foreign missionaries first.  Because the United States took the lead in fighting on South Korea's side, American missionaries were the primary, but not sole, target.  They were accused of being agents of imperialism and of committing many heinous crimes and immoral acts. In most cases the charges were pretexts for expelling the missionaries.  Church leaders who refused to accuse and demonize foreign missionaries were forced to attend political study sessions aimed at  .  Large gatherings were convened to denounce the  , the  , the  , the Christian Literature Society, the  , the  , the  , the  , and the  . Missionary endeavors, which had begun to withdraw following the establishment of the People's Republic, abandoned their efforts and were mostly gone from China in 1951 and 1952. \n The Denunciation Movement had an unexpected side effect of sparking a growth in membership of non-TSRM  , whose congregants claimed pride in practicing the   of self-government, self-propagation, and self-support.  Accusations quickly spread to include influential Chinese Christian leaders and others whose cooperation with the TSRM was deemed inadequate. The Denunciation Movement overlapped with several other   in the early 1950s, including  , the  , the  , and the  . Similar tactics were using including extensive   leading up to public accusation meetings, or   in which the targets were portrayed as counter-revolutionaries.\n Intense pressure was applied to a target's associates to accuse him in virulent terms, the underlying threat being that unless cooperation was rendered the potential accuser would become in turn an object of accusation and punishment. The accusations followed a common structure: \"The general pattern of these denunciation speeches is as follows: First, a general statement of denunciation, usually couched in very strong, not to say violent language; then a list of particulars to susbstantiate the accusation; and finally a demand that the government mete out proper punishment for such betrayal of the Chinese people.\" \n Initially, Christians were reluctant to participate in the movement and early meetings, ordered to start in May, \"were not popular or successful.\"  To push the effort forward, the   of   published an article by Liu Liang-mo (\u5218\u826f\u6a21), a YMCA secretary, on May 15 under the title \"How to Hold a Successful Accusation Meeting.\" Liu wrote, \"Every church and the city-wide church federation ought to first organize an accusation committee. They should first study whom they want to accuse, and whom to invite to do the accusing.\" In preliminary accusation meetings the committee was to \"discover a few people who accuse with the greatest power and invite them to participate in the large accusation meeting,\" at the same time correcting any weaknesses in their speaking. \n Premier Zhou Enlai issued a decree on July 24, part of which stipulated that churches receiving help from American missions should immediately sever all relations and that American mission boards should cease all activities in China.  Because of the widespread failure to induce Christians to participate in the Denunciation Movement,   announced in its August 11 issue that the TSRM was suspending establishing local chapters until the Denunciation Movement, which it called the \"most important task for Christianity in China,\" was \"done well.\"  Helen Ferris, an American missionary to China, reported that having a successful accusation meeting against at least four of its own members had become a prerequisite for any group to register. \n Some Chinese Christian leaders, notably   and  , opposed holding accusation meetings. Wang considered the TSRM's leaders to be   who had denied key tenets of the Christian faith and hence were non-believers.  After outlining his differences with the writings of   and  , Wang wrote, \"We will not unite in any way with these unbelievers, nor will we join any of their organizations.\"  Wang was vehemently attacked by TSRM leaders, particularly Ting, who accused Wang of \"hatred toward the New China.\"  For his stand against TSRM Wang was arrested and charged as a \"counter-revolutionary\" in August 1955. \n Nee felt that accusation meetings led by the government and modernists would intrude upon the church's jurisdiction. Liu-Liang Mo was specifically assigned to hold accusation meetings in Shanghai and the denunciation meetings held there were \"particularly intense.\" One Shanghai meeting drew 12,000 attendees.  By September 15, 1953, there had been 227 large-scale denunciation meetings in 153 cities.  Eventually Liu was able to hold an accusation meeting in the Nanyang Road meeting place of the church in Shanghai, but the meeting fell far below Liu's expectations.  Nee was subsequently arrested on charges related to the   on April 10, 1952, though the propaganda leading up to his trial in 1956 and the TSRM resolution that supported the government's action focused on accusations of \"counter-revolutionary\" activities. \n Other prominent leaders targeted in the Denunciation Movement were Bishop Chen Wen-yuan of the  ;   , dean of the Yanjing School of Religion;  , founder of the  ;  , president of the Chongqing Theological Seminary; and Chao Jingsan (Luther Shao), leader of the Disciples' Church. Though the victims of the Denunciation Movement were charged with being counter-revolutionaries, they were often selected \"not because they had done or spoken anything unpatriotic, but only because they were, in the eyes of the officials, too influential or too popular.\" \n"},

Reports were filed, most many weeks after the events. Many of the reports related a large object flying at low altitude. Some reports also stated that the craft was of a flat, triangular shape, with lights underneath. \n The Belgian UFO wave peaked with the events of the night of 30\u201331 March 1990. On that night, one unknown object was tracked on  , and two     were sent to investigate, with neither pilot reporting seeing the object. No reports were received from the public on the date. But over the next 2 weeks reports from 143 people who claimed to have witnessed the object were received, all of them after the event. Over the ensuing months, many others claimed to have witnessed these events as well.  Following the incident, the Belgian Air Force released a report detailing the events of that night. \n At around 23:00 on 30 March, the supervisor for the Control Reporting Center (CRC) at   received reports that three unusual lights were seen moving towards Thorembais-Gembloux, which lies to the southeast of  . Glons CRC requested the     send a patrol to confirm the sighting. \n Approximately 10 minutes later, some later reports stated that a second set of lights were seen, moving towards the first triangle. Traffic Center Control at   tracked one object only on its radar, and an order to scramble two   fighters from   was given. Throughout this time, in reports after the event, some people claim that the phenomenon was visible from the ground, describing the whole formation as maintaining their relative positions while moving slowly across the sky. \n Over the next hour, the two scrambled F-16s attempted nine separate interceptions of the targets. On three occasions, they managed to obtain a   for a few seconds, but these were later shown to be Radar-locks on each other. The pilots never reported seeing any of the claimed sightings, saw none of the claimed manoeuvres, and never got a lock on any objects apart from the other F16.  The other contacts were all found to be the result of a well-known atmospheric interference called  .\n After 00:30, radar contact became much more sporadic and the final confirmed lock took place at 00:40. Following several further unconfirmed contacts, the F-16s eventually returned to base shortly after 01:00. \n Members of the Wavre gendarmerie who had been sent to confirm the original report, describe four lights now being arranged in a square formation, all making short jerky movements, before gradually losing their luminosity and disappearing in four separate directions at around 01:30. They also reported that a low engine noise was heard and that it seemed to have a stick coming out one end with a turbine on it, which has led many to conclude the object was a helicopter. \n In April 1990, a hoax photo of a triangular object upon which three lights are visible at each corner was taken by an anonymous photographer. Since then, a man named Patrick Mar\u00e9chal  has publicly admitted to creating the hoax \"UFO\" photograph. \n Experts say there is no background in the photograph and no element that would allow calculation of the object's size or distance from the camera. Wim van Utrecht has reproduced a copy of the photograph with devices. A   simulation method  to reproduce the photograph was developed by a Belgian mathematician,   at The   Laboratory of Astrophysics, wherein the apparent \"shake\" motion, that results in the lights of the craft appearing blurred or out of focus in the photograph contradicts eye-witness statements. This, along with the anonymity of the photographer and fact that the image was not produced publicly until 4 months after the alleged event, also brought the authenticity of the image into question.\n For 20 years, the ufological organization   ( ) claimed that this picture was genuine. But on 26 July 2011, in an interview for  , a Belgian TV channel, Patrick Mar\u00e9chal explained that it was a hoax. \n In his 27 September 2016,   episode titled \"The Belgian UFO Wave,\" author   discussed the photographic evidence and said that the single photograph is emblematic of the quality of all the evidence that characterized the Belgian UFO wave. In 2011, Patrick Mar\u00e9chal demonstrated how he had created the hoax UFO, by cutting a piece of styrofoam into a triangle, painting it black, embedding a flashlight in each corner, and hanging it from a string. \n In 1992, about three years after the first sighting, which occurred on 29 November 1989, in Eupen, Marc Hallet wrote an essay about the Belgian UFO wave criticizing the work done by the SOBEPS:  ,  arguing that this UFOlogical organisation was spreading misinformation in the media. Hallet's thesis is that the Belgian UFO wave was mostly a  , boosted by the work done by the SOBEPS. This mass delusion would have followed  's law: \"Once news coverage leads the public to believe that UFOs may be in the vicinity, there are numerous natural and man-made objects which, especially seen at night, can take on unusual characteristics in the minds of hopeful viewers. Their UFO reports in turn add to the mass excitement, which encourages still more observers to watch for UFOs. This situation feeds upon itself until such time as the media lose interest in the subject, and then the flap quickly runs out of steam.\" \n In 1993, Pierre Magain and Marc Remy published an article in  ,  in which their conclusions don't match those from the SOBEPS. They also state that the Belgian UFO wave would be better studied by people in the human sciences than by physicists.\n In  , Renaud Leclet & co. discuss the fact that some sightings can be explained by helicopters. Most witnesses reported that the objects were silent. This report argues that the lack of noise could be due to the engine noise in the witnesses' automobiles, or strong natural wind blowing away from the witnesses. \n In his article  , Jean-Michel Abrassart argues that the beginning of the wave does not contradict the  ,  contrary to what the SOBEPS claimed in his work. In an article published on his website in 2011,  , Auguste Meessen  replied to several criticisms (by Roger Paquay and Jean-Michel Abrassart) and argues that, according to him, the Belgian UFO wave is completely unexplained. Roger Paquay  and Jean-Michel Abrassart  both wrote rebuttals to the Belgian physicist's article.\n In \"The Belgian UFO Wave\"   episode,   discussed the F-16 chase and reported that\n The pilots also got intermittent contact with objects, but they appeared and disappeared and moved up and down too fast, including going underground. The pilots never saw anything at all. SOBEPS reported that they obtained radar lock on targets nine times; but the Belgian military only reported three such locks, and upon analyzing the data, all three radar locks were on each other. The other contacts were all found to be the result of a well-known atmospheric interference called Bragg scattering. Regarding the \"wave\" of eye-witness reports and lack of photographic evidence, Dunning concludes\n You read a story in the paper that a UFO was seen flying over your town a night or two ago. You remember that you saw something you took for a bright star or an airplane, thought nothing of it at the time, but this amazing new story makes you realize that what you saw must have been this UFO. You and I might not necessarily make that connection, but it's perfectly reasonable that a lot of people will; and so they follow the instructions in the newspaper article and send a report to SOBEPS. With so many articles over a period of years in a small country, it's no great surprise that SOBEPS reported they eventually received as many as 2,600 in all. The 143 reports Meessen claims for the original 29 November incident were indeed received, but only after more than a week of aggressive and repeated solicitation in the mass media. It is only much later retellings of the story that wrongly assume all 2,600 were reported as people were watching the F-16s chase the UFOs, or that all 143 initial reports came independently on that first night. All the reports were after the fact, and were only made after prompting and solicitation by SOBEPS and the media.\nIt was simply a psycho-social phenomenon, which is why there is no evidence and only the one questionable photograph. If 13,500 people did all actually see something that they took for a UFO at the time, I guarantee you that more than just a single photograph would have resulted."},

He was the editor of the seminal volume   and founding editor of   in the Study of Time.  His work has strongly influenced thinking about the nature of   across the disciplines from   to  ,   to  , and he was a seminal figure in the general   study of  .  His work has influenced the work of poet   and author  .\n Born and raised in  , Fraser was not drafted into the military on account of his partial Jewish heritage.  Following the  , he emigrated to the United States.  Working as an engineer and an inventor for several years, he registered at least seven US patents between 1958 and 1963.  However, he already began to think about the nature of time much earlier, as early as 1945.  His early training had been in physics, but he completed his Ph.D. in 1969 in the Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Geistes- und Staatswissenschaften (Faculty of Social and Political Sciences) at the  ,  and his dissertation was entitled:  .  Although this work provided a template for many of his later investigations, he had already touched on many of the core ideas in his first articles in 1966, the same year that he founded the International Society for the Study of Time. \n Fraser authored and edited many papers over the next several decades, but following the success of his 1966 edited volume of interdisciplinary articles,  , which remains a regularly cited classic of time studies, he oversaw editing and publication of the first ten volumes of \"The Study of Time\" series through the International Society for the Study of Time.   Subsequent contributions include his role as a founding editor of the interdisciplinary Journal  . \n Fraser died on November 20, 2010, in his home in Westport, Connecticut, which he shared with his wife, Jane, his five children and six grandchildren. \n Throughout his many works, two themes stand out centrally:\n Much of his work is an interplay between these themes, whether played out in disciplinary theatres of the sciences, the arts, the humanities, and history, or as a bridging principle between fields of enquiry themselves.  Arguably, the distinction between disciplines as diverse as those that epistemically belong in the natural and human spheres of knowledge find their methodological and definitional norms informed by his hierarchical theory of time. Indeed, his work fits into the emerging   paradigm, describing as it does how each level of reality emerges, and how that newly emergent level experiences time.\n Fraser posits that the universe has emerged into levels of temporality, beginning with the pure energy of the Big Bang, which he terms atemporality (without-time). As the universe cooled, the quantum physical universe emerged, giving rise to probabilistic prototemporality. With the emergence of molecules and macrophysical objects, we get deterministic eotemporality. The emergence of living things gives rise to a more forward direction of time experience, or biotemporality, which is followed by the strongly directional time experience of human beings, or nootemporality. Fraser then goes on to posit that a sociotemporality has since emerged. Fraser posits that as each level of complexity in the universe encounters unresolvable paradoxes, a new level of complexity emerges, with its own paradoxes.\n These nested levels ( ) represent qualitatively different temporalities, for both time and the perception of time have evolved. In one sense, time is physically different from what it was when the universe first came into being. As the universe continues to change, so too does time change. In the humanistic sense, it is the perception of time that has changed, as humans have biologically evolved with different concepts of the world to those of our ancestral species.\n This biological evolution, and the different perceptions of time that it implies, are played out in every moment in our brain. Our brain functions in one sense as a unitary organ, but evolutionarily it contains different brains: one that controls autonomic function, one that perceives the world in the moment, and one that understands the world intellectually. By this understanding, the biological self that understands only the moment is in perpetual conflict with the intellectual self that conceives of past, present, future, and the possibility of eternity. This, then, at its root is the conflict that underlies the tension of time felt and time understood. People can never resolve the fact that we live in the moment, but dream of the eternal.\n Fraser builds his reasoning on an interpretation of the nature of time that permits a novel understanding of the dynamics of human values. He shows that seeking the true, doing what is right, and admiring what is beautiful, far from promoting permanence, continuity, and balance in individual and social affairs, actually perpetuate the chronic insecurity of the time-knowing species and drive its remarkable creativity and frightening destructiveness. For example let truth as a human value be defined as the recognition of permanence in reality. Its historical function has been the creation of conflicts and, through them, social, cultural, and personal change. Likewise if the quality of a feeling is such as to make one desire its perpetuation, then whatever is believed to be responsible for it is said to be beautiful. Of course the opposite is said to be ugly. The historical function of beauty has again been the creation of conflicts and consequent change.\n Fraser's ideas have consequences not only for our understanding of the physical universe, but also of the emergence of the human mind (a parallel model of which was developed by the psychologist   in his model of psychosocial emergence) and for culture and the arts. For example, Fraser posits that in literature tragedy is the purest expression of the universe's emergent  . Human values are instructions whose purpose is that of keeping alive the unresolvable, creative conflicts of the strange walker.\n \nThese nested levels represent qualitatively different temporalities, for both time and the perception of time have evolved.

As   became more readily available in European countries from the 11th century onwards, wax tablets gradually fell out of use, although they remained relatively common in England, which did not possess a commercially successful paper mill until the late 16th century.  While paper was cheaper than wax, its cost was sufficiently high to ensure the popularity of erasable notebooks, made of specially-treated paper that could be wiped clean and used again. These were commonly known as table-books, and are frequently referenced in Renaissance literature, most famously in  's  : \"My tables,\u2014meet it is I set it down, That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.\" \n Despite the apparent ubiquity of such table-books in Shakespeare's time, very few examples have survived, and little is known about their exact nature, use, or history of production. .The earliest extant edition, bound together with a printed almanac, was made in  , Belgium, in 1527. By the end of this decade, table-books were being imported into England, and they were being printed in   from the 1570s. At this time, however, it appears that the concept of an erasable notebook was still something of a novelty to the British public, as the printed instructions included with some books were headed: \"To make clean your Tables when they be written on, which to some as yet is unknown.\"  The leaves of some table-books were made of donkey skin;  others had leaves of ivory  or simple  .  The coating was made from a mixture of glue and  , and modern-day experiments have shown that ink, graphite and   writing can be easily erased from the treated pages with the application of a wet sponge or fingertip.  Other types of notebook may also have been in circulation during this time; 17th-century writer   describes a table-book made of  , which did \"not need such tedious wiping out by spunges or cloutes\". \n The leaves of a table-book could be written upon with a  , which added to their convenience, as it meant that impromptu notes could be taken without the need for an   (graphite   were not in common use until the late 17th century). Table-books were owned by all classes of people, from merchants to nobles, and were employed for a variety of purposes: \n Surviving copies suggest that at least some owners (and/or their children) used table-books as suitable places in which to learn how to write. Tables were also used for collecting pieces of poetry, noteworthy epigrams, and new words; recording sermons, legal proceedings, or parliamentary debates; jotting down conversations, recipes, cures, and jokes; keeping financial records; recalling addresses and meetings; and collecting notes on foreign customs while traveling. The use of table-books for trivial purposes was often satirized on the English stage. For example,   by   (c. 1600) contains the following exchange: \n  I scorn to retort the obtuse jest of a fool. \n \n  Retort and obtuse, good words, very good words.\n Their use in some contexts was seen as pretentious;  , writing in 1608, describes \"the hypocrite\" as one who, \"in the midst of the sermon pulls out his tables in haste, as if he feared to lose that note\".  The practice of making notes during sermons was a common subject of ridicule, and led to table-books becoming increasingly associated with   during the 17th century. \n By the early 19th century, there was far less demand for erasable notebooks, due to the mass-production of   and the development of cheaper methods for manufacturing paper.  Ordinary paper notebooks became the norm. During the  , British schoolchildren were commonly taught how to make their own notebooks out of loose sheets of paper, a process that involved folding, piercing, gathering, sewing and/or binding the sheets. \n According to a legend, Thomas W. Holley of  , invented the legal pad around the year 1888 when he innovated the idea to collect all the sortings, various sorts of sub-standard paper scraps from various factories, and stitch them together in order to sell them as pads at an affordable and fair price. In about 1900, the latter then evolved into the modern, traditionally yellow legal pad when a local judge requested for a margin to be drawn on the left side of the paper. This was the first legal pad.  The only technical requirement for this type of stationery to be considered a true \"legal pad\" is that it must have margins of 1.25\u00a0inches (3.17 centimeters) from the left edge.  Here, the margin, also known as down lines,  is room used to write notes or comments. Legal pads usually have a gum binding at the top instead of a spiral or stitched binding.\n In 1902, J.A. Birchall of  , a  ,  ,  -based stationery shop, decided that the cumbersome method of selling writing paper in folded stacks of \"quires\" (four sheets of paper or parchment folded to form eight leaves) was inefficient. As a solution, he glued together a stack of halved sheets of paper, supported by a sheet of cardboard, creating what he called the \"Silver City Writing Tablet\". \n Principal types of binding are padding,  ,  ,  , sewn, clasp,  , and pressure, some of which can be combined.   methods can affect whether a notebook can lie flat when open and whether the pages are likely to remain attached. The cover material is usually distinct from the writing surface material, more durable, more decorative, and more firmly attached. It also is stiffer than the pages, even taken together. Cover materials should not contribute to damage or discomfort.\nIt is frequently cheaper to purchase notebooks that are spiral-bound,  meaning that a   of wire is looped through large   at the top or side of the page. Other   notebooks are available that use   to hold the pages together; this process is \"padding.\"  Today, it is common for pages in such notebooks to include a thin line of   that make it easier to tear out the page. Spiral-bound pages can be torn out, but frequently leave thin scraggly strips from the small amount of paper that is within the spiral, as well as an uneven rip along the top of the torn-out page. Hard-bound notebooks include a sewn spine, and the pages are not easily removed. Some styles of sewn bindings allow pages to open flat, while others cause the pages to drape.\n Variations of notebooks that allow pages to be added, removed, and replaced are bound by rings, rods , or discs. In each of these systems, the pages are modified with perforations that facilitate the specific binding mechanism's ability to secure them.   and rod-bound notebooks secure their contents by threading perforated pages around straight or curved prongs. In the open position, the pages can be removed and rearranged. In the closed position, the pages are kept in order.   notebooks remove the open or closed operation by modifying the pages themselves. A page perforated for a disc-bound binding system contains a row of teeth along the side edge of the page that grip onto the outside raised perimeter of individual discs.\n Notebooks used for drawing and scrapbooking are usually blank. Notebooks for writing usually have some kind of printing on the writing material, if only lines to align writing or facilitate certain kinds of drawing.   have page numbers preprinted to support priority claims. They may be considered as  .  Many notebooks have graphic decorations.   can have various kinds of preprinted pages. \n Artists often use large notebooks,  which include wide spaces of blank paper appropriate for drawing. They may also use thicker paper, if painting or using a variety of mediums in their work. Although large, artists' notebooks also are usually considerably light, because they usually take their notebooks with them everywhere to draw scenery. Similarly composers utilize notebooks for writing their lyrics. Lawyers use rather large notebooks known as legal pads that contain   (often yellow) and are appropriate for use on tables and desks. These horizontal lines or \"rules\" are sometimes classified according to their space apart with \"wide rule\" the farthest, \"college rule\" closer, \"legal rule\" slightly closer and \"narrow rule\" closest, allowing more lines of text per page. When sewn into a pasteboard backing, these may be called  , or in smaller signatures may be called \"blue books\" or exam books and used for essay exams.\n Various notebooks are popular among students for taking notes. The types of notebooks used for school work are single line, double line, four line, square grid line etc. These notebooks are also used by students for school assignments (homeworks) and writing projects.\n In contrast, journalists prefer small, hand-held notebooks for portability (reporters' notebooks), and sometimes use   when taking notes. Scientists and other researchers use   to document their experiments. The pages in lab notebooks are sometimes   to plot data. Police officers are required to write notes on what they observe, using a  .   commonly record field notes in durable, hard-bound notebooks called \"field books.\"\n Coloring enthusiasts use coloring notebooks for stress relief. The pages in coloring notebooks contain different adult  .  Students take notes in notebooks, and studies suggest that the act of writing (as opposed to typing) improves learning. \n Notebook pages can be recycled via standard  . Recycled notebooks are available, differing in recycled percentage and paper quality.\n Since the late 20th century, many attempts have been made to integrate the simplicity of a notebook with the editing, searching, and communication capacities of computers through the development of  . Laptop computers began to be called   when they reached a small size in the mid-1990s, but they did not have any special note-taking ability.  Most notably   (PDAs) came next, integrating small   with a   layer to input graphics and written text. Later on, this role was taken over by smartphones and  .\n  combines the simplicity of a traditional pen and notebook with digital storage and interactivity. By printing an invisible dot pattern on the notebook paper and using a pen with a built in infrared camera the written text can be transferred to a laptop, mobile phone or back office for storage and processing.\n"},

Microcomputer chipsets with even more channels were designed; for example, the chipset in the   600 (1995) supports eight-channel memory, but the   of the machine limited operation to four channels.  \n Dual-channel-enabled memory controllers in a PC system architecture use two 64-bit data channels. Dual-channel should not be confused with   (DDR), in which data exchange happens twice per DRAM clock. The two technologies are independent of each other, and many motherboards use both by using DDR memory in a dual-channel configuration.\n Dual-channel architecture requires a dual-channel-capable motherboard and two or more DDR memory modules. The memory modules are installed into matching banks, each of which belongs to a different channel. The motherboard's manual will provide an explanation of how to install memory for that particular unit. A matched pair of memory modules may usually be placed in the first bank of each channel, and a different-capacity pair of modules in the second bank.  Modules rated at different speeds can be run in dual-channel mode, although the motherboard will then run all memory modules at the speed of the slowest module. Some motherboards, however, have compatibility issues with certain brands or models of memory when attempting to use them in dual-channel mode. For this reason, it is generally advised to use identical pairs of memory modules, which is why most memory manufacturers now sell \"kits\" of matched-pair DIMMs. Several motherboard manufacturers only support configurations where a \"matched pair\" of modules are used. A matching pair needs to match in:\n Theoretically any matched pair of memory modules may be used in either single- or dual-channel operation, provided the motherboard supports this architecture.\n With the introduction of  , each DDR5 DIMM has two independent sub-channels.\n Theoretically, dual-channel configurations double the memory bandwidth when compared to single-channel configurations. This should not be confused with   (DDR) memory, which doubles the usage of DRAM bus by transferring data both on the rising and falling edges of the memory bus clock signals.\n Dual-channel was originally conceived as a way to maximize memory throughput by combining two 64-bit buses into a single 128-bit bus.  This is retrospectively called the \"ganged\" mode. However, due to lackluster performance gains in consumer applications,  more modern implementations of dual-channel use the \"unganged\" mode by default, which maintains two 64-bit memory buses but allows independent access to each channel, in support of   with  . \n \"Ganged\" versus \"unganged\" difference could also be envisioned as an analogy with the way   works, when compared to  .  With RAID\u00a00 (which is analogous to \"ganged\" mode), it is up to the additional logic layer to provide better (ideally even) usage of all available hardware units (storage devices, or memory modules) and increased overall performance. On the other hand, with JBOD (which is analogous to \"unganged\" mode) it is relied on the statistical usage patterns to ensure increased overall performance through even usage of all available hardware units. \n  triple-channel architecture is used in the    -900 series (the Intel Core i7-800 series only support up to dual-channel). The LGA 1366 platform (e.g. Intel X58) supports DDR3 triple-channel, normally 1333 and 1600Mhz, but can run at higher clock speeds on certain motherboards. AMD Socket AM3 processors do not use the DDR3 triple-channel architecture but instead use dual-channel DDR3 memory. The same applies to the Intel Core i3,   and Core i7-800 series, which are used on the   platforms (e.g.,  ). According to Intel, a Core i7 with DDR3 operating at 1066\u00a0MHz will offer peak data transfer rates of 25.6\u00a0GB/s when operating in triple-channel   mode. This, Intel claims, leads to faster system performance as well as higher  . \n When operating in triple-channel mode,   is reduced due to interleaving, meaning that each module is accessed sequentially for smaller bits of data rather than completely filling up one module before accessing the next one. Data is spread amongst the modules in an alternating pattern, potentially tripling available memory bandwidth for the same amount of data, as opposed to storing it all on one module.\n The architecture can only be used when all three, or a multiple of three, memory modules are identical in capacity and speed, and are placed in three-channel slots. When two memory modules are installed, the architecture will operate in dual-channel architecture mode. \n \n \n  \n Quad-channel memory debuted on Intel's Nehalem-EX   platform of Xeon CPUs, aka Beckton in 2010, and was introduced to the high end product line on the     platform with Sandy Bridge-E in late 2011.   replaced   on the     platform, aka Haswell-E, and is also used in AMD's   platform.    quad-channel architecture is used in the     platform and in the aforementioned Intel CPUs prior to Haswell. AMD processors for the   platform and Intel processors for the   platform (e.g.  ) use dual-channel DDR3 memory instead.\n The architecture can be used only when all four memory modules (or a multiple of four) are identical in capacity and speed, and are placed in quad-channel slots. When two memory modules are installed, the architecture will operate in a dual-channel mode; When three memory modules are installed, the architecture will operate in a triple-channel mode. \n A benchmark performed by  , using SiSoftware Sandra, measured around 70% increase in performance of a quadruple-channel configuration, when compared to a dual-channel configuration.  Other tests performed by TweakTown on the same subject showed no significant differences in performance, leading to a conclusion that not all benchmark software is up to the task of exploiting increased parallelism offered by the multi-channel memory configurations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Supported by   server processors,  and processors from the Intel Xeon Scalable platform. \n Supported by   server processors, AMD's server processors from their   platform, and the   lineup of professional-class workstation processors. \n Dodeca-channel or 12-channel memory architecture is introduced with AMD's server processors from their   platform released in 2022, using   memory. \n"},

The cities of the state were ruled by municipal magistracies.\n In the 15th and 16th centuries, the spread of   and the privatization of the land by Governor   made the city of Modica the foremost in the south-east of Sicily. The lower part of Modica grew with churches, high-class palaces and monasteries, until the   that killed over 60,000 people in Sicily from   to   and destroyed numerous buildings. The Late Baroque architecture of   is the result of reconstruction following the earthquake.\n On 5 March 1607, Vittoria   Enriquez-Cabrera, Countess of Modica, daughter of the Viceroy   Duke of   and wife of Count Ludovico III Enriquez-Cabrera, founded the new city of  , now the second most populous city in the province of Ragusa.\n  died childless in 1740, and the title passed to his sister  , who was unmarried and also childless. With her death in 1742 two years later, the House of Enr\u00edquez-Cabrera became extinct and by statutes of succession the county passed to  , the great-granddaughter of  . Hereby the county came into possession of the  , and the title is since then held in succession by the   of its three cadet houses: first the House of \u00c1lvarez de Toledo (extinct in 1755), secondly the House of Silva (extinct in 1802), and thirdly the   (extant).\n However, by the time of these dynasties, the title of Count was meaningless and carried little power, and Modica governed itself. This situation continued until the 18th century, when Sicily was ruled by the  . Then, in the late 18th and early 19th century, it was part of the  , ruled from   (this kingdom changed its name to the  ). Finally, after the   it was unified with the rest of Italy, as it is today.\n As head of the House of Alba, the title is currently held by  , who is the 22nd Count of Modica.\n \n \n \n"},

Singh has worked with Montreal based groups such as Solidarity Across Borders and   collective.\n Singh first came into the public spotlight during the protests outside the 1997   conference held in  . According to Canadian Member of Parliament,  , the day before the summit started: \"Jaggi Singh, one of the organizers of the APEC alert ... [was] arrested, wrestled to the ground on the   campus by three plainclothes police officers, handcuffed, thrown in the back of an unmarked car with tinted glass, driven off and locked up during the APEC summit.\" \nSingh was charged with assault after allegedly yelling into the ear of a campus security guard with a megaphone and spent the duration of the conference in jail. In February 1999, the assault charge was dropped by Crown prosecutors before going to trial. \n Singh was one of 51 people to file a complaint against the conduct of the   (RCMP) at the APEC summit that sparked a formal investigation by the Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP. In March 2000, he was one of three people to formally withdraw from the inquiry, alleging that Prime Minister  's rejection of an invitation to testify before the Commission was proof that the process was flawed. \n In one of the findings condemning RCMP behavior issued in the final report by the Commission, it was noted that: \"Mr. Jaggi Singh was arrested on a warrant based on a spurious charge; the manner of his arrest was inappropriate in the circumstances; the timing of the arrest was calculated to prevent him from attending protests on November 25; the bail conditions sought were overly restrictive.\" \n Singh continued to attend Canadian rallies and protests, and continued to face arrests. In October 2000, he was arrested at a   protest in Montreal, and charged with \"participation in a riot\", illegal assembly, and mischief. Police claimed that Singh\u2019s speech against the   incited the crowd, and that he announced the availability of medical help while riot police were charging at the crowd.  In April 2003, he was acquitted of the riot charges. \n Singh gained notoriety as the longest-detained demonstrator arrested by police at the  .  Witnesses reported that, \"he was grabbed from behind by police masquerading as protesters\" and \"dragged away in a beige van\".  Singh was held for a total of 17 days, and charged with breaking conditions from previous arrests and with weapons charges - for a   that launched teddy bears that was actually constructed and operated by an unrelated group from  , which released a satirical statement denying Singh's involvement with the catapult.  He was released on $3,000 bail with conditions that prohibited him from leading or organizing any demonstrations or using a megaphone. \n \nIn a telephone interview conducted while he was in the Orsainville jail near  , Singh explained his view that legal action against him and other political activists was designed to intimidate them into silence, and split them off from mainstream public opinion:  \"Everybody is an idealist. Everybody has this idea that things should be better and that's really a non-ideological thing. The fear is that those idealists will become radicals and start questioning the roots of the system, start questioning the power structure. People in power don't like that. You have to turn these idealists into realists, because once they're realists, they can accept the compromises that opportunists make; those being the politicians.  \n \n \nAnd how do you turn an idealist into a realist instead of a radical? Well, a baton blow to the head is one way. Getting wafts of tear gas is another. Yet another is making the radicals seem crazy and criminal. Give the distinct impression through the media that you will be jailed. You will be treated differently and it's not worth the trouble. As long as idealists stay that way, or even better become realists or opportunists, that's great.\" During the lengthy pre-trial process, the weapons charge was dropped, and Singh\u2019s request in November 2003 for a stay of proceedings based on \"unreasonable delay and abuse of process,\" was accepted two months before the case would have gone to trial in January 2004. In his ruling, Judge Beaulieu of the Quebec Superior Court agreed with Singh\u2019s position that: \"... the bail conditions imposed on May 2001 have restrained his right to freedom, opinion, expression and the right of freedom of association as protected by article 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\" \n Singh was also known for his pro-  activism and for organizing protests in and around Montreal. \n On September 9, 2002, he participated in a protest against a speech by   Prime Minister   which was to be presented by the pro-Israel   club at  , with support from the  .  The talk was canceled when confrontations between protestors, police and security agents became violent, resulting in widespread coverage in the media, including an article in   written by Singh himself. \n In January 2003, Singh was deported by Israeli authorities after having gone to the   on an invitation from the  . He had initially been denied entrance to the country upon his arrival in December 2002, but fought the decision in court. Though he won the right to stay for three weeks, he was barred from visiting the West Bank.  Singh refused to abide by the order and made public his reasons for doing so, writing: \"It's not for an occupying power to decide who can or can't enter\nPalestine... I've decided then to ignore the Israeli security services and listen to the Palestinian activists. It was an easy choice to make.\"  On January 8, 2003, Singh was nabbed by undercover police officers in Jerusalem. He was held at the   and then the  , before being   back to Canada. \n On January 20, 2003, Singh was to speak at a demonstration in support of students facing disciplinary charges for the September 9 protest against Benjamin Netanyahu. He was arrested on university campus by police and charged with illegal assembly, obstruction, mischief, assault, conspiracy and breaking prior conditions, for the September 9 protest. \n Singh mounted his own defense and filed an abuse of process motion after the prosecution failed to disclose more than 30 unedited videos taken by surveillance cameras the day of the protest. He put it to the court that the videos showed inconsistencies with the evidence given by security guards and supported his version of events. \nIn his ruling, Montreal Municipal Court Judge Pierre Fontaine wrote that the   Administration had exhibited \" \" that amounted to a \"flagrant violation\" of Singh's  . The dismissal of the charges at that time meant that Singh enjoyed his first totally clean judicial record in years. \n The Crown successfully appealed Judge Fontaine's decision and the charges were reinstated.  In his judgement  rendered on August 23, 2006, Superior Court of Quebec Judge   wrote: \"the trial judge erred when he held that officials of Concordia University were grossly negligent in not volunteering the production of the videocassettes before receiving a subpoena   during the motion hearing. My reading of the transcripts leads me to the exact opposite conclusion. Officials of Concordia were exemplary in their co-operation with the prosecution and the Court. They were exemplary in their dealings with the Respondent during the hearing of the motion.\"\n On April 19, 2006, Singh was attending a pro-Palestinian poetry-reading/music fundraising event, \norganized by Sumoud  at the El Salon cafe, when he was arrested by Montreal police.  Reports conflict as to what happened exactly. Police say they were responding to an allegation of assault reported by a \"taxi driver\" outside the cafe. They say they attempted to question Singh about the alleged assault and pursued him inside the cafe to do so, but that many of the 70 people in attendance attempted to obstruct them. Singh says the man who police say was a taxi driver was wearing a suit and driving an unmarked  . He says that the man pushed him after Singh asked him what he was doing parked on the side of the road wearing an earpiece. Police ended up charging Singh and one other person with obstruction, and three others were given municipal fines. \n In 2004, the   drew reference to Singh in an article about protesters against the  . The article incorrectly spoke of Singh receiving firearms training from   and that the teddy-bears launched of the Quebec Summit of the Americas had been soaked in gasoline.  At the same time, the   published a photo of someone they alleged to be Singh shooting off a handgun. \n Singh claimed that he did not throw himself into the spotlight due to an awareness of how the media likes to develop cults of personality: \"I didn't choose to be covered in the way I have been. I've said no to interviews far more often than I've said yes.\"  In 2001, when the CBC's The Fifth Estate aired a documentary profile of Singh, it was difficult to get his cooperation. Anna Maria Tremonti, the show's host, noted that \"Often, people clamour to get in front of a microphone. But Jaggi didn't clamour.\" \n Singh does acknowledge that not all his dealings with the media have been bad: \"There are some journalists who are willing to take time on a story. That doesn't mean days, it just means making a couple of calls and getting all the background information so the story is not exploitative.\" \n He was interviewed and included in a PBS documentary #  :\n  about the global political economy.\n Singh provided an \"activist arrest and trial calendar\" to the United Nations   in support of a complaint filed by  , outlining heavy-handed Montreal police tactics that had resulted in 2,000 arrests between 1999 and 2004.  In November 2005, the UN body's report singled out Montreal police for the disproportionate use of mass arrests, stating: \"The State party should ensure that the right of persons to peacefully participate in social protests is respected, and ensure that only those committing criminal offences during demonstrations are arrested ... The Committee also invites the State party to conduct an inquiry into the practices of the Montreal police forces during demonstrations, and wishes to receive more detail about the practical implementation of article 63 of the Criminal Code relating to unlawful assembly.\"  Singh cited the results of the report as a vindication for Montreal activists: \"The report validates what protesters have been saying about these protests, that these mass arrests are essentially a tactic by Montreal police to prevent by fear the involvement of young people who take to the streets in protest.\" \n In talks at   and   of Montreal, Singh has outlined the links between   and the work of groups like No One Is Illegal towards protecting the rights of refugee claimants in Canada and migrants around the world. He has said that, \"You can't define human beings as illegal, as exploitable [or] as non-status.\" He has also criticized the high bar for refugee status in Canada saying that, \"You have to prove that there is a gun to your head or there will be a gun to your head,\" in order to be allowed to stay. \n Singh also took part in a protest of Immigration Minister  's speech at the annual meeting of   in 2006, demanding a   on all deportations of refugees. He was one of about a dozen protestors whose presence was cited as a disruption of the event, and which resulted in Solberg cancelling his speech and leaving the hall. \n On November 24, 2006, Singh was arrested yet again and charged with violating earlier bail conditions for taking part in a 15-person protest against Canadian involvement in the war on   at a press conference convened by Canadian Prime Minister   at the Montreal General Hospital. \n The arresting officer\u2019s report stated that the RCMP asked Singh to leave based on his reputation as a political dissident and that he was arrested for refusing to leave after being asked to by hospital security. \n At the bail hearing, the prosecution argued for denial of bail on the basis that Singh\u2019s history of arrests made it likely that he would re-offend.  In his defense, Singh stated that, \"I was targeted not for what I did, but for my reputation,\" and further pointed out that he had won five of the six cases previously brought against him. \n Singh submitted that, \"Standing up and asking a question is not illegal. Standing up and challenging the Prime Minister\u2019s policies is not illegal.\" \n Municipal Court Judge Pascal Pillarella ruled that Singh had not actually violated the conditions of his earlier bail and should not have to spend months in jail awaiting trial. Singh was released on $2000 bail, and his trial for charges including obstruction and assault was scheduled for May 2007. \n On March 8, 2007, Singh attended a demonstration for   in Montreal where he was again arrested by police. He was held in jail for five days. At the bail hearing, police contended that Singh violated a bail condition prohibiting him from attending illegal or non-peaceful demonstrations. Several witnesses, including a C\u00e9gep professor and a medical resident at the Montreal Children\u2019s Hospital, testified that the women\u2019s day march had been peaceful. He was released on $1000 bail. The judge commented that the \"hefty bond\" might work to deter Singh\u2019s activism. \n A judge ruled that the protest was declared 'unpeaceful' by police only in order to arrest Singh.  The Quebec Court of Appeals upheld a lower Superior Court decision that ordered two Montreal police officers to pay Singh $15,000, and $1,000 in damages. \n In June 2010, Singh participated in the   during the   in  .  According to immigrant rights group  , Singh turned himself into   following the issuance of an arrest warrant. \nHe was granted bail on July 12, after $10,000 was paid by two sureties, one of which was the Qu\u00e9bec provincial deputy  , from the  . In addition to this bail, $75,000 more, guaranteed this time by Amir Khadir and two other people whose identities were not revealed, will be charged if Singh breaks his release conditions, which are the following: house arrest at the home of one of the guarantors; handing in his passport to the authorities; he must not use a cellular phone; he must not have any contact with the 16 other activists charged with conspiracy in connection with the G20 protests. \n"},

Its track measures   ( ), making it larger than   but slightly smaller than  , which came to be the dominant U.S. standard during the 1920s.\n Gauge one was standardised, according to   magazine of August 1909, at   ( ). An exact 1:32 scale would yield   ( ) for standard gauge prototype. The distance between the wheel tyres was set at  \u00a0in (38.894\u00a0mm) and between the centre of the track 48\u00a0mm (no inch equivalent suggesting it was metric users' requirement only). The wheel width was set at  \u00a0in (7.541\u00a0mm).\n Definitions using gauge, rather than scale, were more common in the early days with the four gauges for which standards were adopted being No. 0 (commonly called   currently), No. 1,   and No. 3.\n Initially as popular in the   as in the  , 1 gauge lost popularity in the U.S. due to  , which dramatically decreased foreign imports, allowing the U.S. wide gauge standard to gain traction. After World War I, most surviving U.S. manufacturers switched to wide gauge. In the UK and the rest of the world, 1 gauge also declined, although more slowly, and by the 1940s had practically disappeared.\n In the 1950s and 1960s 1 gauge experienced a renaissance, first in the UK and then elsewhere. This was helped by 1 gauge being the same size as the modern  , a popular standard for outdoor model railways.\n Although vintage 1 gauge trains use the same track standard as modern  , scale modeling was not a primary design consideration in 1 gauge's heyday, so the actual size and scale of the locomotives and cars (UK, wagons) varied. Generally, 1 gauge equipment works out to approximately   (roughly 10\u00a0mm = 1 foot).   at 1:22.5 means the 1 gauge track represents   ( )   track. Such railways are to be found in, among other places,  , the inspiration source for many commercial G gauge models.\n Due to the size of the locomotives it is possible for them to be powered with  , which to many is a large advantage as they are cheaper than traditional live steam  . These are usually fired by gas or  , which are both very popular. Another form, which is becoming popular, is coal, which gives the user the smell that only steam locomotives carry.\n Accucraft Trains  in California, The Gauge One Model Railway Company  in Britain, and Aster Hobbies Ltd  in Japan produce gauge 1 items, mostly coal, methylated spirits, and butane fired.\n Wrightway Rolling Stock  produce a range of quality coaches for British outline gauge one railways and a range of cars for North American and European outline railways. They can supply from their range or custom build. Some of the range is available in 10\u00a0mm scale.\n , in  , has produced several different lines of trains that can be considered 1 gauge.  Their first production took place in the late 1800s, with a line of \"tinplate\" type trains.  This line was discontinued in favour of their more popular 0 gauge trains.  In the late 1960s, M\u00e4rklin re-entered the large scale market with a modest range of 1 gauge trains.  Based upon one drive mechanism made of metal, M\u00e4rklin produced both a German Class 80 0-6-0T steam locomotive in two different liveries and a 0-Co-0 diesel based upon a Henschel design.  This early range included two-axle passenger cars, two-axle box cars and tank cars, all made of plastic.  The tank cars could hold liquids and the box car and passenger car had operating doors.  This range continued in production for a number of years, but was gradually replaced with more accurate locomotives and larger cars.  The range expanded to include a Class 38 4-6-0, a Class 78 4-6-4T and a Class 212 Bo-Bo diesel.  In the late 1980s the M\u00e4rklin 1 gauge line included a large number of freight car designs in different liveries and a range of three axle passenger cars.  The earlier passenger cars and box cars were retained, while the tank cars were discontinued.\n In the early 2000s, M\u00e4rklin added a second line of gauge one trains under the brand name \"Maxi\".  These trains were made of stamped metal and were more toylike in appearance in comparison to their scale version of 1 gauge trains.  The Maxi line was intended to compete against the more popular LGB product line, which also operates on 45\u00a0mm gauged track, but is scaled to IIm standards.  As the Maxi line matured, the toylike shiny appearance gradually gave way to matte finishes.  This was in response to European market requests, while the toylike appearance was considered to be more popular in the North American market.  In later years, the Maxi product line was gradually folded into the conventional M\u00e4rklin 1 gauge product line, with the mark \"Maxi\" disappearing around 2008.  One of the last locomotives marketed under the \"Maxi\" brand was a Class V60, which had a stamped metal frame and cast metal superstructure.  This locomotive is considered to be the end of the Maxi line.

It places emphasis on the transformation of Selena from a popular entertainer into a modern-day saint and role model.  This documentary uses authentic home videos, news stories, footage from concerts and a debate between intellectuals to analyze the effect of Selena and Selena's murder at the hands of Yolanda Saldivar, the president of her fan club. \n Apart from showing the rapid trajectory of Selena's fame, this documentary also shows the long-lasting effect that Selena has had and continues to have. The movie contains teary interviews from people from every age group that try to talk about Selena and her effect.  The film starts off with footage from Selena's death, which is quite unusual based on the fact that most people view death as the end. The effect of placing Selena's death at the beginning of the film gives the viewer the effect that Selena's death was not the end, but the beginning.  This film relies a great deal on the interview with fans and family members that describe Selena's fame as influential in their lives.  When interviewing some fans at the Tejano Fine Arts Academy in Corpus Christi, Selena's effect is viewed through the way that the performers emulate their idol by swiveling their hips and lip-synching to her songs. At the gravesite we continue to witness the effect that Selena continues to have through the devotion of her followers. Fans leave flowers, Selena dolls and even write intimate letters to Selena, with the faith of Selena reading it.  A fan explains this devotion by stating, \n \u201cSometimes, we see people that we want to be like them, not because of their fame, but because of the way they act with people and we just want to share that. Almost every day, we make a tribute to her in our souls, in our hearts, and in our minds.\u201d Another important aspect of this film is the debate between scholars about Selena's influence. Although scholars can agree on Selena being an important influence even after her death, they differ on that influence being labeled positive or negative.  On one hand, scholars categorize it as positive based on the fact that Selena's body breaks away from the norm of a white, thin, blue eyed women becoming famous. Selena breaks away from the preconceived notion that beauty only exists in one form. On the other hand, other scholars do not believe that Selena is such a positive role model.  As Sandra Cisneros argues,\n \"You are telling people to go out there and be sexy and design their own clothes. That\u2019s not a role model that I want for any young girl. And the fact that the only outlet that you have is to be this sexual being singing songs that aren\u2019t even that wonderful and that you have to die before you are 25 and that makes you successful. That\u2019s how you get on the cover of the Texas Monthly, you either get shot, raped or bludgeoned.\" . \n Selena continues to have ever lasting effects on her fans evident through their devotion at her grave site, people singing her songs, people dressing up like her or simply causing scholars to discuss her influence.\n  differentiates itself from other Selena films based on the fact that this film's primary focus is unlike the 1997 Selena biographical drama film by Gregory Nava which primary focus is on Selena's life through her performances, this film primary focus is interviews with fans, family and friends. Focusing on interviews provides the viewer with a clear example of Selena's effect on people even after her death. Most films, including this one emphasize that Selena was becoming famous even though she failed to meet the set standards of beauty meaning skinny, blue eyes and blonde hair. Yet unlike other films, this film shows the controversy of some people who believe that Selena was not a good influence. According to critics, Selena broke with some preconceptions of beauty yet played into other stereotypes. An aspect that most films about Selena have in common is portraying Selena as a role model for the meaning of success for the working class Latinos. In this film, this idea is portrayed by disk jockey Vicente Carranza stating,\n \u201cShe was the first one to hit everyone\u2019s soul at the same time. The Mexican community, the Chicano community, the Puerto Rican community, all of them together.  , they all relate to her. The upper-middle class Mexican American didn\u2019t relate to her because they didn\u2019t want to associate with the music of the lower people. And the Anglos definitely did not because of the Spanish. But after her death there is no barrier.\u201d . \n Apart from most films portraying Selena as virtuous, Selena is also shown as a modern-day saint.  This is most evident in this film through the images and interviews at Selena's gravesite. People cry and write letters not just for Selena, but to what Selena stood for according to them.\n"},
